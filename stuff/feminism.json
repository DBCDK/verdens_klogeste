Born in London and raised in San Diego, Ratajkowski rose to prominence in 2013 after appearing in the music video for Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\", which became the number-one song of the year in several countries. Ratajkowski appeared on the cover of the March 2012 issue of the erotic magazine treats!, which led to her being asked to appear in two music videos\u00a0\u2013 \"Blurred Lines\" and Maroon 5's \"Love Somebody\". She appeared in the 2014 and 2015 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. Ratajkowski made her professional runway modeling debut for Marc Jacobs at New York Fashion Week in 2015 and has since walked on the Paris Fashion Week runway for Miu Miu and Milan Fashion Week for Bottega Veneta, Dolce & Gabbana and Versace. She appeared in a Buick Super Bowl commercial during Super Bowl 50. She has become the spokesperson for brands such as DKNY, The Frye Company, Kerastase, Paco Rabanne and DL1961. Ratajkowski began acting as a child in San Diego before she gained a recurring role on the Nickelodeon series iCarly (2009\u20132010). Her feature film debut was as the mistress of Ben Affleck's character in the 2014 film Gone Girl. Ratajkowski's other roles have included the films Entourage (2015), We Are Your Friends (2015), I Feel Pretty (2018) and Welcome Home (2018), as well as the miniseries The Spoils Before Dying (2015) and the anthology series Easy (2016). Ratajkowski is an advocate for women's health issues as a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood. As a self-identified feminist, she has received both support and criticism for her views on sexual expression. Emily O'Hara Ratajkowski was born on June 7, 1991, in Westminster, London, the only child of Polish-American parents, Kathleen Anne Balgley and John David \"J.D.\" Ratajkowski.[6][7][8] Balgley, who earned her PhD from the University of California, San Diego,[6] became a lecturer of English at the University of California, Los Angeles. She then taught American literature in Poland from September 1987 to July 1988, and again from September 1988 to July 1989, under the Fulbright Program.[9] Balgley met Ratajkowski, a painter and art teacher, while they were both teaching at San Dieguito Academy in Encinitas, California.[6][10] At the time of their daughter's birth, they were aged 39 and 45, respectively,[11] and unmarried.[12] Ratajkowski describes her mother as a \"feminist and intellectual\".[13] The family lived in West Kensington and Bloomsbury[14] before settling in San Diego, California, when Ratajkowski was five.[8] She was raised primarily in nearby Encinitas.[15] Balgley formerly taught at California Polytechnic State University,[15] and as of 2011[update], teaches at San Diego Jewish Academy.[6] Ratajkowski is of Irish, German, Polish, and Polish Jewish descent.[16][10] Her father was raised Roman Catholic, whereas her mother was raised Jewish.[6] Before Ratajkowski left London at the age of five, she was obsessed with theater.[17] She began acting as a child, staging shows for her family. Her earliest role was as Elsa in the North Coast Repertory Theatre School's The Little Match Girl.[18] In 2004, she played Harriet in the interactive Lyceum Theatre production of Harriet Potter and the Throne of Applewort.[19] Ratajkowski tried soccer, acting, and ballet before modeling.[3] Ratajkowski visited nude beaches in Europe with her family during her youth.[8] Exposure to the nude female figure in photography and art during her formative years, including the work of her father, as well as the photography of Helmut Newton and Herb Ritts, prepared Ratajkowski for nude work. She has said, \"We have this culture of men, especially, watching pornography, but then [they are] offended by a classic nude portrait or photograph, and I've never felt that way.\"[20] She was also influenced by third-wave feminism and works such as The Beauty Myth and Promiscuities by Naomi Wolf.[21] With encouragement from an acting coach, Ratajkowski met and signed with a talent agent who contacted Ford Models.[22] That same day,[17] she signed with Ford at age 14 and went on to do teen print catalog modeling for Kohl's and Nordstrom.[8] At 15, Ratajkowski began auditioning for Disney and iCarly roles,[17] but as she pursued acting she was often typecast as a bully or cheerleader, and decided to stop auditioning until she had garnered enough clout to be more selective about her roles.[8][23] She attended San Dieguito Academy, a high school in San Diego, while modeling and acting in Los Angeles.[23] After two nondescript movie roles, she appeared as Gibby's girlfriend, Tasha, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon's iCarly (2009\u20132010).[3][24] Her manager discouraged her from pursuing many acting engagements until she could be more selective.[8][23] Ratajkowski attended UCLA for one year in 2009, then decided to model full-time.[8] She later said that she found the fine art education at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture arbitrary and in conflict with her artistic concepts, and that she did not enjoy socializing with fellow students.[25] After campaigns and editorials with photographer Tony Duran,[10] Ratajkowski began shooting more fashion editorials and posed for several early issues of the artistic erotica magazine treats!, including the cover of its third issue, in March 2012.[8][26] She credits that cover for bringing her the two unsolicited, high-profile, music video roles.[13][27] Ratajkowski later filmed commercials for Nikon and Carl's\u00a0Jr.,[8] including multiple versions of a 2012 Carl's\u00a0Jr. commercial with Sara Jean Underwood.[28][29] She also did nude and clothed art modeling for magazines,[15] including a May 2012 shoot with Jonathan Leder,[30][31] as well as work for Frederick's of Hollywood;[32] a 2012 holiday video and a 2011 Valentine's video in which Ratajkowski appeared for the company are among the most popular videos on the company's YouTube channel.[33] Ratajkowski worked with photographer Tony Kelly for the March 2013 GQ Turkey cover.[34] Ratajkowski appeared in Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams's 2013 video, \"Blurred Lines\".[3][8] Previously, Ratajkowski had been cast in two other music videos: \"Fast Car\" by Taio Cruz,[35] which was released on November 5, 2012,[36] and Maroon 5's \"Love Somebody\",[3] which was released two months after \"Blurred Lines\".[3][13] \"Love Somebody\", shot on January 16,[37] and \"Blurred Lines\" were both produced in 2013.[3][38] The video for \"Love Somebody\" was released on May 21, 2013.[39] Directed by Rich Lee, it shows bare-chested Adam Levine using inverse green screen technology to rub paint onto Ratajkowski with his hands. As they touch, they reveal each other.[40][41] Thicke had seen Ratajkowski's treats! cover that The New York Times's Bee Shapiro described as \"an artfully composed black-and-white photograph of Ms. Ratajkowski sitting completely nude with her knees tucked to her chest\" and convinced director Diane Martel to cast her in the \"Blurred Lines\" music video. Martel felt that \"she looked smart and stunningly beautiful\" in the photo.[8] Ratajkowski initially declined the role, fearing being classified as a music video model,[8] but Martel persuaded her.[15] The video was released on March 20, 2013.[42] On March 28, Thicke posted an explicit version,[43][44] with a topless Ratajkowski.[13] \"Blurred Lines\" was controversial: its video was called sexist for its perceived degradation of women,[45] and some felt its lyrics promoted rape.[46][47] Others disagreed,[48][49] asserting that the lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom.[50] Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: \"it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing.\"[45] Ratajkowski did not think of the video as sexist[13] and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, \"took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting\".[51][52] She said that the song \"gave me an opportunity to say the things that I felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture.\"[20] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner:[53] the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have,[20] and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.[54] \"Blurred Lines\", and Ratajkowski's associated video performance, was prominent beyond the sociopolitical controversies. The song became the number-one song of 2013 on music charts in many countries, including Canada,[55] Ireland,[56] the Netherlands,[57] New Zealand,[58] and the United Kingdom.[59] Although second on the year-end US Billboard Hot 100 chart,[60] the song's twelve consecutive weeks at number one made it the longest-running number-one song of the decade until \"Uptown Funk\" spent fourteen consecutive weeks at number one in 2015.[61][62] The song also remained in the news due to a copyright infringement lawsuit and appeal.[63][64][65] The \"Blurred Lines\" video garnered Ratajkowski notoriety,[13] especially as a sex symbol.[66] In October 2013, Esquire magazine named Ratajkowski \"Woman of the Year\", over online fan vote finalist Jennifer Lawrence.[67] That December, Rolling Stone magazine listed her among its twenty hottest sex symbols.[66] In February 2014, Sports Illustrated magazine named Ratajkowski as one of twelve 50th anniversary swimsuit issue rookies.[68] In April, FHM ranked her the fourth sexiest woman in the world.[69] Maxim magazine included Ratajkowski at number\u00a062 on its 2014 Hot 100 list.[70][71] AskMen ranked her the third most desirable woman of 2014.[72] Ratajkowski was on the July 2013 cover of CR Fashion Book, which included erotic scenes with Karlie Kloss and male models, photographed by Bruce Weber.[8][13][73] On June 24, she appeared topless in the July 2014 American GQ cover story, photographed by Michael Thompson.[74][75] A controversy ensued at retailer Lands' End, some of whose customers received the issue for free. Some customers objected to the racy images, forcing Lands' End CEO Edgar Huber to apologize.[76] Ratajkowski leveraged her sudden prominence into supporting roles in major films.[8] Ratajkowski played Andie Fitzgerald, the mistress of Ben Affleck's character, in David Fincher's 2014 adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl.[77] Affleck encouraged Fincher to consider Ratajkowski after seeing the \"Blurred Lines\" video.[20] U-T San Diego described Ratajkowski's performance as \"nuanced\",[54] while Andrew O'Hehir of Salon and Wesley Morris of Grantland wrote that her small role as a \"duplicitous and manipulative former student\" was critical.[78][79] Reflecting on the performance in 2016, Wolf described Ratajkowski's portrayal as sympathetic and compassionate.[17] Days after Gone Girl's September 26, 2014, New York Film Festival premiere,[80][81] Ratajkowski became the cover model for the November 2014 issue of Cosmopolitan.[82] On October 30, 2014, she appeared with Taylor Kitsch in the Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare live-action trailer.[83][84] Ratajkowski appeared on the February 2015 FHM cover,[85] but she tweeted that her picture was used without her consent.[86][87] FHM responded that \"we liked the pictures so much we stuck one on our front cover\".[88] Ratajkowski co-starred in the 2015 film Entourage as a fictionalized version of herself,[15][89] playing the love interest of Adrian Grenier's character, Vincent Chase.[90] Her performance received critical commentary ranging from \"less than compelling\", by The Hollywood Reporter's Sheri Linden, to \"uncanny realism\", by The Philadelphia Inquirer's Steven Rea.[91][92] Grantland's Morris described her role and performance with scathing sarcasm.[93] She was also cast in the 2015 miniseries The Spoils Before Dying as Agent Day, appearing late in the series.[94][95][96] Her performance was favorably reviewed by Emily L. Stephens of The A.V. Club,[97] while other critics commented that she was part of a solid supporting cast.[98][99] Ratajkowski earned her first leading role, opposite Zac Efron, in We Are Your Friends,[100] a musical drama released in August 2015, and was part of the film's promotional tour to Europe and North America.[101] Starting with the August 11 London premiere,[102][103] this tour marked her ascension as a style icon as she earned multiple best dressed citations from various sources.[104][105] She played Stanford University dropout Sophie,[106] the love interest of Efron's character and girlfriend/personal assistant of Wes Bentley's character.[107] Her performance received mixed reviews. Alonso Duralde of TheWrap described the role as thin, as did Ty Burr of The Boston Globe.[108][109] Burr said that Ratajkowski's performance was \"surpassingly dull\",[108] while Nell Minow of Beliefnet stated that she \"does more posing than acting\".[110] Kyle Smith of the New York Post described her performance as \"quietly entrancing\",[111] and Jordan Hoffman of the Daily News described Ratajkowski's performance as \"stunning and sweet\".[112] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph and Grantland's Morris noted Ratajkowski's rhythmic dancing skills and sex appeal, as previously seen in \"Blurred Lines\".[113][114] Around the time of the release of We Are Your Friends, Ratajkowski appeared on the covers of Grazia France,[115] British GQ,[116] harper by Harper's Bazaar,[117] InStyle UK,[118] and InStyle Australia,[119] as well as a role as a 2015 MTV Video Music Awards presenter.[120][121] The British GQ cover story was photographed by Mario Testino, who produced a short film featuring Ratajkowski for the magazine's website.[53][122] Soon after, on September 17, 2015, she made her runway debut for Marc Jacobs at the spring/summer 2016 New York Fashion Week finale.[123][124] This appearance contributed to her number-one listing among Vogue's 12 Breakout Beauty Stars of 2015.[125] For fall/winter 2016 fashions, Ratajkowski walked the Paris Fashion Week runway for Miu Miu on March 9, 2016.[126][127] She has expressed the desire to break barriers for shorter and more curvaceous models, commenting: \"You don't have to be 5'9\" and an A-cup to be a successful model.\"[128] A Buick Super Bowl ad for its Cascada convertible during Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016, featured Ratajkowski and Odell Beckham Jr.[129][130] The ad, in which she made a wedding bouquet catch reminiscent of Beckham's catch from 2014,[131][132] received average ratings, according to USA Today's admeter.[133] The ad was filmed with a stunt double making the catch.[134] Los Angeles-based jewelry designer Jacquie Aiche featured Ratajkowski in a spring 2016 campaign wearing almost nothing but body chains, rings, bracelets, pendants, and chokers.[135][136][137] In May, Ratajkowski appeared in the Russian-language music video \"Inseparable\" (sometimes translated as \"Indivisible\") with Russian entertainer Dima Bilan as a photographer and Ratajkowski as his muse.[138][139][140] Ratajkowski was one of five models to appear on the August 2016 Vogue Germany alternate covers along with Stella Maxwell, Irina Shayk, Lily Aldridge, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.[141] Along with Joan Smalls and Kate Upton, Ratajkowski was one of three models for the October Glamour cover.[142] The cover story, which was shot by Carter Smith and includes an essay by Ratajkowski, says she has become known as an activist who considers being both sexual and serious to be non-conflicting ambitions.[143] She appeared in a season 1 episode of Joe Swanberg's Netflix series, Easy that was released on September 22, 2016.[144][145] Her episode, in which she is a lifecasting selfie artist, met with mixed reviews.[146][147][148] She was a guest judge on the October 20, Project Runway season 15 episode.[149] By November 2016, Ratajkowski was attached to Lying and Stealing, which also starred Theo James.[150] Ratajkowski began 2017 on the February Vogue Espa\u00f1a cover shot by Miguel Reveriego.[151][152] Ratajkowski also made cover appearances on the March issue of U.S. InStyle,[153] and the May covers of American Marie Claire (with alternate covers by Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Aja Naomi King, Zoey Deutch, Alexandra Daddario, et al.) and the French L'Officiel.[154][155] In 2017, Ratajkowski promoted Fyre Festival on Instagram with Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and other actresses/models.[156] Ratajkowski was reportedly the only actress or model to use the hashtag #ad,[157] but has since deleted the post.[158] The Federal Trade Commission has said #ad only worked if at the beginning of paid posts, and that the hashtag alone was not a sufficient disclaimer.[158][159] A second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters in Los Angeles was filed.[160] The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying over 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it. The parties are accused of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.[161] On June 27. she was announced as the cover model for the August 2017 Australian Harper's Bazaar, which had different newsstand and subscriber covers photographed by Pamela Hanson.[162] In July 2017 after modelling for the French fashion brand The Kooples's Fall 2017 collection, Ratajkowski was enlisted to design a 38-piece bag collection for the company. The initial version of the collection, named Emily By The Kooples, comes in 6 colors and features a leather carryall bag, The Emily Bag.[163][164] The bags are Italian-made and represent The Kooples' first foray into bags.[165][166] Later that month she was announced as the feature of cover stories in the August issues of Allure[167][168] and British Glamour[169] as well as a nude Patrick Demarchelier photospread for Love magazine.[170] Ratajkowski played Jessica Weintraub, the female lead opposite Spencer Boldman in the film Cruise, which was written and directed by Robert Siegel.[171] She was hired as part of the cast of the film In Darkness, alongside Natalie Dormer, Ed Skrein, and Stacy Martin.[172] Ratajkowski had a role opposite Aaron Paul in Welcome Home.[173] On September 23, she walked the Milan Fashion Week runway for Bottega Veneta.[174][175] Later that month, Ratajkowski revealed that she was working with a dialogue coach to learn the French and Italian languages for Lying and Stealing.[176][177] On November 1, Tyga posted an unofficial 60-second video teaser for \"Tequilla Kisses\", which featured Ratajkowski.[178] As a result, Ratajkowski was noted as the starring performer in Tyga's \"Tequilla Kisses\" bonus track music video.[176] However, on November 4, Tyga removed the full video from various points of internet access including his own Instagram account,[179][180] following complaints from Ratajkowski that the video was from a lookbook Ratajkowski did with Phillip Lopez in 2013.[181][178] On November 9, Harper's Bazaar UK published a story about Ratajkowski's impending release of her own swimwear brand after Emrata Holdings LLC acquired the trademark to Inamorata in August and she left a trail of breadcrumbs on social media. Ratajkowski retweeted the story.[182] The bathing suit line, Inamorata, went live on November 16, 2017 with three bikini separates and three one-pieces.[183][184] Ratajkowski co-starred alongside Amy Schumer in the 2018 comedy film I Feel Pretty.[185] Her role, which was described as \"pivotal\" by USA Today critic Bryan Alexander,[186] included ad libbed improvisational comedy.[187] On March 29, 2018, was cast as a series regular in the NBC pilot Bright Futures.[188][189] The yet unaired pilot was compared to Friends and How I Met Your Mother.[190] The show was not included in NBC's 2018\u201319 schedule.[191] She was featured on the cover of the June 2018 issue of Marie Claire.[192] She designed the mythology-themed \"EmRata x Spinelli Kilcollin\" jewelry collection with Spinelli Kilcollin that launched at Barneys New York on May 30, 2018, with prices starting at $6,000.[193] On September 21, 2018, Ratajkowski walked the Milan Fashion Week runway for Versace.[194][195] That same weekend, she walked fashion week for Dolce & Gabbana.[196] Ratajkowski has been frequently named in lists and polls that rank beauty or fashion in the media. She was ranked in Maxim's Hot 100 list in both 2014 (No.\u00a062)[70] and 2015 (No.\u00a02).[citation needed] AskMen ranked her among its most desirable women of 2014 (No.\u00a03)[72] and 2016 (No.\u00a014);[197] while FHM ranked her among the sexiest in 2014 (No.\u00a04),[69] and 2015 (No.\u00a018).[198] She is also praised for her fashion sense: Ratajkowski made Vogue Italia's Best Dressed List of 2015,[199] and Harper's Bazaar placed her atop its best dressed list at the February 2016 New York Fashion Week.[200] In their respective reviews of We Are Your Friends, Richard Roeper and Wesley Morris said that Ratajkowski, again playing the attractive object of affection, again failed to demonstrate acting prowess.[113][201] Ratajkowski described the pressure that she endured as a youth around her sexuality and her thoughts on female sexual empowerment, in Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter newsletter on February 16, 2016.[202][203][204] Elle magazine, Esquire magazine, and Harper's Bazaar republished her letter.[205][206][207] Critics, including Glamour magazine's Hayley Spencer,[208] The Huffington Post's Jenavieve Hatch,[209] and Rachael Moon of the Daily Mirror, praised it.[210] According to Cosmopolitan magazine's Nikki Kinstlinger and Georgia Simmonds of Marie Claire, Ratajkowski finds self-empowerment in defining and owning the expression of her sexuality and body.[211][212] Salon's Erin Coulehan described the essay's identification of a societal catch-22, in which showcasing female sexuality that may \"offend, excite, or create envy\" leads to criticism and body shaming.[213] InStyle's Isabella Silvers concurred that \"female sexuality isn't always for the benefit of someone else\".[214] Charlotte Gill of The Independent admitted that she was in the minority in finding the letter \"rambling\" and \"dull\".[215] Ratajkowski defended Kim Kardashian from criticism when Kardashian posted a controversial naked selfie on Instagram in March 2016, saying that women have the right to \"express their sexuality and share their bodies however they choose\".[216] Then, Kardashian and Ratajkowski jointly advocated via social media for female sexual empowerment and against body shaming; nearly one million social media followers responded positively, and prominent global media outlets took notice.[217][218][219] Following her letter and social media statement, the controversy about her feminism heightened. Piers Morgan stated that Ratajkowski's form of feminism was a misguided affront to true feminism,[220] labeling it pseudo-feminist gibberish.[221] After Morgan wrote that \"feminism as it was intended is dead\", the Chicago Tribune's Heidi Stevens, as well as The Daily Telegraph's Helen Pankhurst (Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter) said that Ratajkowski neither killed nor bolstered feminism.[222][223] Women's Wear Daily's Taylor Harris questioned the impact of Ratajkowski's feminism.[224] The Independent's Gill questioned Ratajkowski's feminism, saying that her professional activities \"continued to advocate industries that treat us as pieces of meat\".[215] Heather Saul of The Independent wrote in support of Ratajkowski in an article subtitled \"Ratajkowski is becoming an important feminist voice in the debate over female censorship and sexuality\".[225] New York's Allie Jones called Ratajkowski \"the best feminist celeb\".[226] In August 2016, Ratajkowski became the spokesperson for the Australian swimwear brand Amore + Sorvete.[227] According to a November 26, 2016, story on Page Six of the New York Post, 71 photographs taken by Leder in May 2012 were being printed in a publication by Imperial Publishing and set for display in a New York art gallery in February 2017.[228] On November 30, 2016, Ratajkowski tweeted that she was being featured in the photobook publication without her consent. New York noted that Ratajkowski had claimed that the pictures were intended for use in an artful magazine,[30] while USA Today noted that she had hesitated to protest because she did not want to give Leder publicity.[31] In March 2017, she became the face of DKNY intimates.[229] In August she became the face of DL1961 jeans.[230] In August 2017, Ratajkowski became the face of The Frye Company for its Fall 2017 ad campaign.[231] That August, she became the face of the entire DKNY brand for its fall 2017 campaign.[232] In September 2017, Ratajkowski took issue with image editing done for the cover of the Madame Figaro issue included in the Saturday September 16 issue Le Figaro.[233][234] American Vogue ran a feature article the following month for her \"stylistic excellence\".[235] In January 2018, Ratajkowski shot a fashion campaign with Inez and Vinoodh, as the new ambassador for K\u00e9rastase.[236] British Vogue noted that the Kerastase endorsement was Ratajkowski's \"first beauty campaign\".[237] Then in March 2018, she landed her first fragrance campaign as the face of Paco Rabanne Parfum's women's line.[238][239] She also earned the University of Southern California Inspire Award in at their inaugural ceremony in March 2018.[192][240] On April 8, 2018, Ratajkowski won the Model of the Year award from the Daily Front Row.[241][242] In September 2014, Ratajkowski was a victim in a female celebrity hacking and internet posting wave of stolen nude iCloud photographs.[243][244] In December 2014, Us Weekly confirmed she had begun dating musician Jeff Magid.[245] By early 2018, they had reportedly broken up.[246] On February 23, 2018, Ratajkowski announced on Instagram that she had married actor and producer Sebastian Bear-McClard, her boyfriend of several weeks, in a surprise New York City courthouse wedding.[247] Ratajkowski has raised funds,[248] done public service announcements,[249] and committed to a short film promoting reproductive and sexual health for Planned Parenthood.[250][251] Ratajkowski's involvement has drawn fire from right to life advocates such as the National Right to Life Committee.[252] Ratajkowski says she enjoys freedom of sexual expression \"while still being a feminist\",[82] and is outspoken about using her celebrity to support the empowerment of women and women's sexuality.[253] Amanda Hess of Slate questioned whether she is a feminist or an opportunist exploiting feminism.[254] On the eve of the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ratajkowski spoke at a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire to endorse his campaign.[255][256][257] One of the main points of her speech, and her social media activity surrounding it, was to counter Gloria Steinem's statement that young female Sanders supporters were involved in the campaign to meet potential male romantic partners.[258][259] In 2020, she endorsed Sanders once again for the Democratic nomination.[260][261]",

Born in London and raised in San Diego, Ratajkowski rose to prominence in 2013 after appearing in the music video for Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\", which became the number-one song of the year in several countries.\nRatajkowski appeared on the cover of the March 2012 issue of the erotic magazine treats!, which led to her being asked to appear in two music videos\u00a0\u2013 \"Blurred Lines\" and Maroon 5's \"Love Somebody\". She appeared in the 2014 and 2015 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. Ratajkowski made her professional runway modeling debut for Marc Jacobs at New York Fashion Week in 2015 and has since walked on the Paris Fashion Week runway for Miu Miu and Milan Fashion Week for Bottega Veneta, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Versace. She appeared in a Buick Super Bowl commercial during Super Bowl 50. She has become the spokesperson for brands such as DKNY, The Frye Company, Kerastase, Paco Rabanne and DL1961.\nRatajkowski began acting as a child in San Diego before she gained a recurring role on the Nickelodeon series iCarly (2009\u20132010). Her feature film debut was as the mistress of Ben Affleck's character in the 2014 film Gone Girl. Ratajkowski's other roles have included the films Entourage (2015), We Are Your Friends (2015), I Feel Pretty (2018) and Welcome Home (2018), as well as the miniseries The Spoils Before Dying (2015) and the anthology series Easy (2016).\nRatajkowski is an advocate for women's health issues as a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood. As a self-identified feminist, she has received both support and criticism for her views on sexual expression.\nEmily O'Hara Ratajkowski was born on June 7, 1991, in Westminster, London, the only child of Polish-American parents, Kathleen Anne Balgley and John David \"J.D.\" Ratajkowski.[6][7][8] Balgley, who earned her PhD from the University of California, San Diego,[6] became a lecturer of English at the University of California, Los Angeles.  She then taught American literature in Poland from September 1987 to July 1988, and again from September 1988 to July 1989, under the Fulbright Program.[9] Balgley met Ratajkowski, a painter and art teacher, while they were both teaching at San Dieguito Academy in Encinitas, California.[6][10] At the time of their daughter's birth, they were aged 39 and 45, respectively,[11] and unmarried.[12] Ratajkowski describes her mother as a \"feminist and intellectual\".[13] The family lived in West Kensington and Bloomsbury[14] before settling in San Diego, California, when Ratajkowski was five.[8] She was raised primarily in nearby Encinitas.[15] Balgley formerly taught at California Polytechnic State University,[15] and as of 2011[update], teaches at San Diego Jewish Academy.[6]\nRatajkowski is of Irish, German, Polish, and Polish Jewish descent.[16][10] Her father was raised Roman Catholic, whereas her mother was raised Jewish.[6]\nBefore Ratajkowski left London at the age of five, she was obsessed with theater.[17] She began acting as a child, staging shows for her family.  Her earliest role was as Elsa in the North Coast Repertory Theatre School's The Little Match Girl.[18] In 2004, she played Harriet in the interactive Lyceum Theatre production of Harriet Potter and the Throne of Applewort.[19] Ratajkowski tried soccer, acting, and ballet before modeling.[3]\nRatajkowski visited nude beaches in Europe with her family during her youth.[8] Exposure to the nude female figure in photography and art during her formative years, including the work of her father, as well as the photography of Helmut Newton and Herb Ritts, prepared Ratajkowski for nude work. She has said, \"We have this culture of men, especially, watching pornography, but then [they are] offended by a classic nude portrait or photograph, and I've never felt that way.\"[20] She was also influenced by third-wave feminism and works such as The Beauty Myth and Promiscuities by Naomi Wolf.[21]\nWith encouragement from an acting coach, Ratajkowski met and signed with a talent agent who contacted Ford Models.[22] That same day,[17] she signed with Ford at age 14 and went on to do teen print catalog modeling for Kohl's and Nordstrom.[8] At 15, Ratajkowski began auditioning for Disney and iCarly roles,[17] but as she pursued acting she was often typecast as a bully or cheerleader, and decided to stop auditioning until she had garnered enough clout to be more selective about her roles.[8][23]\nShe attended San Dieguito Academy, a high school in San Diego, while modeling and acting in Los Angeles.[23] After two nondescript movie roles, she appeared as Gibby's girlfriend, Tasha, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon's iCarly (2009\u20132010).[3][24] Her manager discouraged her from pursuing many acting engagements until she could be more selective.[8][23]\nRatajkowski attended UCLA for one year in 2009, then decided to model full-time.[8] She later said that she found the fine art education at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture arbitrary and in conflict with her artistic concepts, and that she did not enjoy socializing with fellow students.[25]\nAfter campaigns and editorials with photographer Tony Duran,[10] Ratajkowski began shooting more fashion editorials and posed for several early issues of the artistic erotica magazine treats!, including the cover of its third issue, in March 2012.[8][26] She credits that cover for bringing her the two unsolicited, high-profile, music video roles.[13][27] Ratajkowski later filmed commercials for Nikon and Carl's\u00a0Jr.,[8] including multiple versions of a 2012 Carl's\u00a0Jr. commercial with Sara Jean Underwood.[28][29] She also did nude and clothed art modeling for magazines,[15] including a May 2012 shoot with Jonathan Leder,[30][31] as well as work for Frederick's of Hollywood;[32] a 2012 holiday video and a 2011 Valentine's video in which Ratajkowski appeared for the company are among the most popular videos on the company's YouTube channel.[33] Ratajkowski worked with photographer Tony Kelly for the March 2013 GQ Turkey cover.[34]\nRatajkowski appeared in Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams's 2013 video, \"Blurred Lines\".[3][8] Previously, Ratajkowski had been cast in two other music videos: \"Fast Car\" by Taio Cruz,[35] which was released on November 5, 2012,[36] and Maroon 5's \"Love Somebody\",[3] which was released two months after \"Blurred Lines\".[3][13]\n\"Love Somebody\", shot on January 16,[37] and \"Blurred Lines\" were both produced in 2013.[3][38] The video for \"Love Somebody\" was released on May 21, 2013.[39] Directed by Rich Lee, it shows bare-chested Adam Levine using inverse green screen technology to rub paint onto Ratajkowski with his hands. As they touch, they reveal each other.[40][41]\nThicke had seen Ratajkowski's treats! cover that The New York Times's Bee Shapiro described as \"an artfully composed black-and-white photograph of Ms. Ratajkowski sitting completely nude with her knees tucked to her chest\" and convinced director Diane Martel to cast her in the \"Blurred Lines\" music video. Martel felt that \"she looked smart and stunningly beautiful\" in the photo.[8] Ratajkowski initially declined the role, fearing being classified as a music video model,[8] but Martel persuaded her.[15] The video was released on March 20, 2013.[42] On March 28, Thicke posted an explicit version,[43][44] with a topless Ratajkowski.[13]\n\"Blurred Lines\" was controversial: its video was called sexist for its perceived degradation of women,[45] and some felt its lyrics promoted rape.[46][47] Others disagreed,[48][49] asserting that the lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom.[50] Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: \"it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing.\"[45] Ratajkowski did not think of the video as sexist[13] and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, \"took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting\".[51][52] She said that the song \"gave me an opportunity to say the things that I felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture.\"[20] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner:[53] the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have,[20] and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.[54]\n\"Blurred Lines\", and Ratajkowski's associated video performance, was prominent beyond the sociopolitical controversies. The song became the number-one song of 2013 on music charts in many countries, including Canada,[55] Ireland,[56] the Netherlands,[57] New Zealand,[58] and the United Kingdom.[59] Although second on the year-end US Billboard Hot 100 chart,[60] the song's twelve consecutive weeks at number one made it the longest-running number-one song of the decade until \"Uptown Funk\" spent fourteen consecutive weeks at number one in 2015.[61][62] The song also remained in the news due to a copyright infringement lawsuit and appeal.[63][64][65]\nThe \"Blurred Lines\" video garnered Ratajkowski notoriety,[13] especially as a sex symbol.[66] In October 2013, Esquire magazine named Ratajkowski \"Woman of the Year\", over online fan vote finalist Jennifer Lawrence.[67] That December, Rolling Stone magazine listed her among its twenty hottest sex symbols.[66] In February 2014, Sports Illustrated magazine named Ratajkowski as one of twelve 50th anniversary swimsuit issue rookies.[68] In April, FHM ranked her the fourth sexiest woman in the world.[69] Maxim magazine included Ratajkowski at number\u00a062 on its 2014 Hot 100 list.[70][71] AskMen ranked her the third most desirable woman of 2014.[72]\nRatajkowski was on the July 2013 cover of CR Fashion Book, which included erotic scenes with Karlie Kloss and male models, photographed by Bruce Weber.[8][13][73] On June 24, she appeared topless in the July 2014 American GQ cover story, photographed by Michael Thompson.[74][75] A controversy ensued at retailer Lands' End, some of whose customers received the issue for free. Some customers objected to the racy images, forcing Lands' End CEO Edgar Huber to apologize.[76]\nRatajkowski leveraged her sudden prominence into supporting roles in major films.[8] Ratajkowski played Andie Fitzgerald, the mistress of Ben Affleck's character, in David Fincher's 2014 adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl.[77] Affleck encouraged Fincher to consider Ratajkowski after seeing the \"Blurred Lines\" video.[20] U-T San Diego described Ratajkowski's performance as \"nuanced\",[54] while Andrew O'Hehir of Salon and Wesley Morris of Grantland wrote that her small role as a \"duplicitous and manipulative former student\" was critical.[78][79] Reflecting on the performance in 2016, Wolf described Ratajkowski's portrayal as sympathetic and compassionate.[17]\nDays after Gone Girl's September 26, 2014, New York Film Festival premiere,[80][81] Ratajkowski became the cover model for the November 2014 issue of Cosmopolitan.[82] On October 30, 2014, she appeared with Taylor Kitsch in the Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare live-action trailer.[83][84] Ratajkowski appeared on the February 2015 FHM cover,[85] but she tweeted that her picture was used without her consent.[86][87] FHM responded that \"we liked the pictures so much we stuck one on our front cover\".[88]\nRatajkowski co-starred in the 2015 film Entourage as a fictionalized version of herself,[15][89] playing the love interest of Adrian Grenier's character, Vincent Chase.[90] Her performance received critical commentary ranging from \"less than compelling\", by The Hollywood Reporter's Sheri Linden, to \"uncanny realism\", by The Philadelphia Inquirer's Steven Rea.[91][92] Grantland's Morris described her role and performance with scathing sarcasm.[93] She was also cast in the 2015 miniseries The Spoils Before Dying as Agent Day, appearing late in the series.[94][95][96] Her performance was favorably reviewed by Emily L. Stephens of The A.V. Club,[97] while other critics commented that she was part of a solid supporting cast.[98][99]\nRatajkowski earned her first leading role, opposite Zac Efron, in We Are Your Friends,[100] a musical drama released in August 2015, and was part of the film's promotional tour to Europe and North America.[101] Starting with the August 11 London premiere,[102][103] this tour marked her ascension as a style icon as she earned multiple best dressed citations from various sources.[104][105] She played Stanford University dropout Sophie,[106] the love interest of Efron's character and girlfriend/personal assistant of Wes Bentley's character.[107] Her performance received mixed reviews. Alonso Duralde of TheWrap described the role as thin, as did Ty Burr of The Boston Globe.[108][109] Burr said that Ratajkowski's performance was \"surpassingly dull\",[108] while Nell Minow of Beliefnet stated that she \"does more posing than acting\".[110] Kyle Smith of the New York Post described her performance as \"quietly entrancing\",[111] and Jordan Hoffman of the Daily News described Ratajkowski's performance as \"stunning and sweet\".[112] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph and Grantland's Morris noted Ratajkowski's rhythmic dancing skills and sex appeal, as previously seen in \"Blurred Lines\".[113][114]\nAround the time of the release of We Are Your Friends, Ratajkowski appeared on the covers of Grazia France,[115] British GQ,[116] harper by Harper's Bazaar,[117] InStyle UK,[118] and InStyle Australia,[119] as well as a role as a 2015 MTV Video Music Awards presenter.[120][121] The British GQ cover story was photographed by Mario Testino, who produced a short film featuring Ratajkowski for the magazine's website.[53][122] Soon after, on September 17, 2015, she made her runway debut for Marc Jacobs at the spring/summer 2016 New York Fashion Week finale.[123][124] This appearance contributed to her number-one listing among Vogue's 12 Breakout Beauty Stars of 2015.[125] For fall/winter 2016 fashions, Ratajkowski walked the Paris Fashion Week runway for Miu Miu on March 9, 2016.[126][127] She has expressed the desire to break barriers for shorter and more curvaceous models, commenting: \"You don't have to be 5'9\" and an A-cup to be a successful model.\"[128]\nA Buick Super Bowl ad for its Cascada convertible during Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016, featured Ratajkowski and Odell Beckham Jr.[129][130] The ad, in which she made a wedding bouquet catch reminiscent of Beckham's catch from 2014,[131][132] received average ratings, according to USA Today's admeter.[133] The ad was filmed with a stunt double making the catch.[134] Los Angeles-based jewelry designer Jacquie Aiche featured Ratajkowski in a spring 2016 campaign wearing almost nothing but body chains, rings, bracelets, pendants, and chokers.[135][136][137] In May, Ratajkowski appeared in the Russian-language music video \"Inseparable\" (sometimes translated as \"Indivisible\") with Russian entertainer Dima Bilan as a photographer and Ratajkowski as his muse.[138][139][140]\nRatajkowski was one of five models to appear on the August 2016 Vogue Germany alternate covers along with Stella Maxwell, Irina Shayk, Lily Aldridge, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.[141] Along with Joan Smalls and Kate Upton, Ratajkowski was one of three models for the October Glamour cover.[142] The cover story, which was shot by Carter Smith and includes an essay by Ratajkowski, says she has become known as an activist who considers being both sexual and serious to be non-conflicting ambitions.[143]  She appeared in a season 1 episode of Joe Swanberg's Netflix series, Easy that was released on September 22, 2016.[144][145] Her episode, in which she is a lifecasting selfie artist, met with mixed reviews.[146][147][148] She was a guest judge on the October 20, Project Runway season 15 episode.[149] By November 2016, Ratajkowski was attached to Lying and Stealing, which also starred Theo James.[150]\nRatajkowski began 2017 on the February Vogue Espa\u00f1a cover shot by Miguel Reveriego.[151][152] Ratajkowski also made cover appearances on the March issue of U.S. InStyle,[153] and the May covers of American Marie Claire (with alternate covers by Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Aja Naomi King, Zoey Deutch, Alexandra Daddario, et al.) and the French L'Officiel.[154][155]\nIn 2017, Ratajkowski promoted Fyre Festival on Instagram with Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and other actresses/models.[156] Ratajkowski was reportedly the only actress or model to use the hashtag #ad,[157] but has since deleted the post.[158] The Federal Trade Commission has said #ad only worked if at the beginning of paid posts, and that the hashtag alone was not a sufficient disclaimer.[158][159] A second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters in Los Angeles was filed.[160] The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying over 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it. The parties are accused of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.[161] On June 27. she was announced as the cover model for the August 2017 Australian Harper's Bazaar, which had different newsstand and subscriber covers photographed by Pamela Hanson.[162]\nIn July 2017 after modelling for the French fashion brand The Kooples's Fall 2017 collection, Ratajkowski was enlisted to design a 38-piece bag collection for the company. The initial version of the collection, named Emily By The Kooples, comes in 6 colors and features a leather carryall bag, The Emily Bag.[163][164] The bags are Italian-made and represent The Kooples' first foray into bags.[165][166] Later that month she was announced as the feature of cover stories in the August issues of Allure[167][168] and British Glamour[169] as well as a nude Patrick Demarchelier photospread for Love magazine.[170]\nRatajkowski played Jessica Weintraub, the female lead opposite Spencer Boldman in the film Cruise, which was written and directed by Robert Siegel.[171] She was hired as part of the cast of the film In Darkness, alongside Natalie Dormer, Ed Skrein, and Stacy Martin.[172] Ratajkowski had a role opposite Aaron Paul in Welcome Home.[173] On September 23, she walked the Milan Fashion Week runway for Bottega Veneta.[174][175] Later that month, Ratajkowski revealed that she was working with a dialogue coach to learn the French and Italian languages for Lying and Stealing.[176][177] On November 1, Tyga posted an unofficial 60-second video teaser for \"Tequilla Kisses\", which featured Ratajkowski.[178] As a result, Ratajkowski was noted as the starring performer in Tyga's \"Tequilla Kisses\" bonus track music video.[176] However, on November 4, Tyga removed the full video from various points of internet access including his own Instagram account,[179][180] following complaints from Ratajkowski that the video was from a lookbook Ratajkowski did with Phillip Lopez in 2013.[181][178] On November 9, Harper's Bazaar UK published a story about Ratajkowski's impending release of her own swimwear brand after Emrata Holdings LLC acquired the trademark to Inamorata in August and she left a trail of breadcrumbs on social media. Ratajkowski retweeted the story.[182] The bathing suit line, Inamorata, went live on November 16, 2017 with three bikini separates and three one-pieces.[183][184]\nRatajkowski co-starred alongside Amy Schumer in the 2018 comedy film I Feel Pretty.[185] Her role, which was described as \"pivotal\" by USA Today critic Bryan Alexander,[186] included ad libbed improvisational comedy.[187] On March 29, 2018, was cast as a series regular in the NBC pilot Bright Futures.[188][189] The yet unaired pilot was compared to Friends and How I Met Your Mother.[190] The show was not included in NBC's 2018\u201319 schedule.[191] She was featured on the cover of the June 2018 issue of Marie Claire.[192] She designed the mythology-themed \"EmRata x Spinelli Kilcollin\" jewelry collection with Spinelli Kilcollin that launched at Barneys New York on May 30, 2018, with prices starting at $6,000.[193]\nOn September 21, 2018, Ratajkowski walked the Milan Fashion Week runway for Versace.[194][195] That same weekend, she walked fashion week for Dolce &amp; Gabbana.[196]\nRatajkowski has been frequently named in lists and polls that rank beauty or fashion in the media. She was ranked in Maxim's Hot 100 list in both 2014 (No.\u00a062)[70] and 2015 (No.\u00a02).[citation needed] AskMen ranked her among its most desirable women of 2014 (No.\u00a03)[72] and 2016 (No.\u00a014);[197] while FHM ranked her among the sexiest in 2014 (No.\u00a04),[69] and 2015 (No.\u00a018).[198] She is also praised for her fashion sense: Ratajkowski made Vogue Italia's Best Dressed List of 2015,[199] and Harper's Bazaar placed her atop its best dressed list at the February 2016 New York Fashion Week.[200]\nIn their respective reviews of We Are Your Friends, Richard Roeper and Wesley Morris said that Ratajkowski, again playing the attractive object of affection, again failed to demonstrate acting prowess.[113][201]\nRatajkowski described the pressure that she endured as a youth around her sexuality and her thoughts on female sexual empowerment, in Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter newsletter on February 16, 2016.[202][203][204] Elle magazine, Esquire magazine, and Harper's Bazaar republished her letter.[205][206][207] Critics, including Glamour magazine's Hayley Spencer,[208] The Huffington Post's Jenavieve Hatch,[209] and Rachael Moon of the Daily Mirror, praised it.[210] According to Cosmopolitan magazine's Nikki Kinstlinger and Georgia Simmonds of Marie Claire, Ratajkowski finds self-empowerment in defining and owning the expression of her sexuality and body.[211][212] Salon's Erin Coulehan described the essay's identification of a societal catch-22, in which showcasing female sexuality that may \"offend, excite, or create envy\" leads to criticism and body shaming.[213] InStyle's Isabella Silvers concurred that \"female sexuality isn't always for the benefit of someone else\".[214] Charlotte Gill of The Independent admitted that she was in the minority in finding the letter \"rambling\" and \"dull\".[215]\nRatajkowski defended Kim Kardashian from criticism when Kardashian posted a controversial naked selfie on Instagram in March 2016, saying that women have the right to \"express their sexuality and share their bodies however they choose\".[216] Then, Kardashian and Ratajkowski jointly advocated via social media for female sexual empowerment and against body shaming; nearly one million social media followers responded positively, and prominent global media outlets took notice.[217][218][219]\nFollowing her letter and social media statement, the controversy about her feminism heightened. Piers Morgan stated that Ratajkowski's form of feminism was a misguided affront to true feminism,[220] labeling it pseudo-feminist gibberish.[221] After Morgan wrote that \"feminism as it was intended is dead\", the Chicago Tribune's Heidi Stevens, as well as The Daily Telegraph's Helen Pankhurst (Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter) said that Ratajkowski neither killed nor bolstered feminism.[222][223] Women's Wear Daily's Taylor Harris questioned the impact of Ratajkowski's feminism.[224] The Independent's Gill questioned Ratajkowski's feminism, saying that her professional activities \"continued to advocate industries that treat us as pieces of meat\".[215] Heather Saul of The Independent wrote in support of Ratajkowski in an article subtitled \"Ratajkowski is becoming an important feminist voice in the debate over female censorship and sexuality\".[225] New York's Allie Jones called Ratajkowski \"the best feminist celeb\".[226]\nIn August 2016, Ratajkowski became the spokesperson for the Australian swimwear brand Amore + Sorvete.[227] According to a November 26, 2016, story on Page Six of the New York Post, 71 photographs taken by Leder in May 2012 were being printed in a publication by Imperial Publishing and set for display in a New York art gallery in February 2017.[228] On November 30, 2016, Ratajkowski tweeted that she was being featured in the photobook publication without her consent.  New York noted that Ratajkowski had claimed that the pictures were intended for use in an artful magazine,[30] while USA Today noted that she had hesitated to protest because she did not want to give Leder publicity.[31]\nIn March 2017, she became the face of DKNY intimates.[229] In August she became the face of DL1961 jeans.[230] In August 2017, Ratajkowski became the face of The Frye Company for its Fall 2017 ad campaign.[231] That August, she became the face of the entire DKNY brand for its fall 2017 campaign.[232]\nIn September 2017, Ratajkowski took issue with image editing done for the cover of the Madame Figaro issue included in the Saturday September 16 issue Le Figaro.[233][234] American Vogue ran a feature article the following month for  her \"stylistic excellence\".[235] In January 2018, Ratajkowski shot a fashion campaign with Inez and Vinoodh, as the new ambassador for K\u00e9rastase.[236] British Vogue noted that the Kerastase endorsement was Ratajkowski's \"first beauty campaign\".[237] Then in March 2018, she landed her first fragrance campaign as the face of Paco Rabanne Parfum's women's line.[238][239] She also earned the University of Southern California Inspire Award in at their inaugural ceremony in March 2018.[192][240] On April 8, 2018, Ratajkowski won the Model of the Year award from the Daily Front Row.[241][242]\nIn September 2014, Ratajkowski was a victim in a female celebrity hacking and internet posting wave of stolen nude iCloud photographs.[243][244] In December 2014, Us Weekly confirmed she had begun dating musician Jeff Magid.[245] By early 2018, they had reportedly broken up.[246] On February 23, 2018, Ratajkowski announced on Instagram that she had married actor and producer Sebastian Bear-McClard, her boyfriend of several weeks, in a surprise New York City courthouse wedding.[247]\nRatajkowski has raised funds,[248] done public service announcements,[249] and committed to a short film promoting reproductive and sexual health for Planned Parenthood.[250][251] Ratajkowski's involvement has drawn fire from right to life advocates such as the National Right to Life Committee.[252]\nRatajkowski says she enjoys freedom of sexual expression \"while still being a feminist\",[82] and is outspoken about using her celebrity to support the empowerment of women and women's sexuality.[253] Amanda Hess of Slate questioned whether she is a feminist or an opportunist exploiting feminism.[254]\nOn the eve of the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ratajkowski spoke at a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire to endorse his campaign.[255][256][257] One of the main points of her speech, and her social media activity surrounding it, was to counter Gloria Steinem's statement that young female Sanders supporters were involved in the campaign to meet potential male romantic partners.[258][259] In 2020, she endorsed Sanders once again for the Democratic nomination.[260][261]\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos (/j\u0259\u02c8n\u0252p\u0259l\u0259s/;[7] born Milo Hanrahan, 18 October 1984), or pen name Milo Andreas Wagner,[8] is a British far-right[2] political commentator, polemicist, public speaker, writer and activist. Yiannopoulos is a former editor for Breitbart News and describes himself as a \"cultural libertarian\". Through his speeches and writings, he ridicules Islam, feminism, social justice, and political correctness.[9][10][11] Leaked emails have shown that Yiannopoulous's book, Dangerous, and many of his Breitbart articles were ghost-written by a Breitbart colleague.[12] Yiannopoulos worked for Breitbart from 2014 until 2017. During his time at Breitbart Yiannopoulos rose to prominence as a significant voice in the Gamergate controversy. In July 2016, he was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment.[13][14] He was permanently banned from Facebook in 2019.[15][16] According to hundreds of emails by Yiannopoulous leaked by Buzzfeed in late 2017, Yiannopoulos repeatedly solicited white nationalists, such as American Renaissance editor Devin Saucier, for story ideas and editing suggestions during his tenure at Breitbart.[12] The emails show that this was an effort to appeal to a racist readership through dog-whistling. Yiannopoulos has been accused of being an apologist for or supporting paedophilia. The allegation arose from several video clips in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be \"perfectly consensual\" and positive experiences for the boys.[17] Following the release of the video, Yiannopoulos was forced out of his position at Breitbart, his invitation to speak before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was revoked, and a contract to publish his autobiography with Simon & Schuster was cancelled. Yiannopoulos has said that he is not a supporter of paedophilic relationships and that his statements were merely attempts to cope with his own victimhood, as an object of child abuse by unnamed older men. Born as Milo Hanrahan, Yiannopoulos was born and raised in Chatham, Kent, England.[18] His father is of half-Greek and half-Irish descent. His parents divorced when he was a boy.[19][4][4] Raised by his mother and her second husband, Yiannopoulos has stated that he did not have a good relationship with his stepfather and has spoken of how his stepfather would beat him. He is described as a practising Roman Catholic, but has also said that he is Jewish; Yiannopoulos states his maternal grandmother was Jewish. As a teenager, Yiannopoulos lived with his paternal grandmother whose surname he later adopted.[20] Yiannopoulos was educated at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury from which he has said he was expelled. He attended the University of Manchester but dropped out before graduating; he then read English at Wolfson College, Cambridge, but was sent down (expelled) in 2010.[21] In 2017, Yiannopoulos was a U.S. resident alien on O-1 visa status. He married his long-term boyfriend in Hawaii, in September 2017. The couple prefer at present to keep the identity of his husband secret.[22] After he dropped out of university, Yiannopoulos initially secured a job at The Catholic Herald. In 2009, Yiannopoulos moved to technology journalism with The Daily Telegraph.[23] In November 2011, Yiannopoulos co-founded The Kernel.[24] In March, 2013, The Kernel was shut down amidst allegations of unpaid wages, at a time when Yiannopoulos was the Editor-in-Chief and sole director of the parent company, Sentinel Media.[9] It was reopened later that year under Kernel Media, with Yiannopoulos remaining Editor-in-Chief and having privately settled the previous debts.[24] In 2014, The Kernel was acquired by Daily Dot Media, the parent company of The Daily Dot. After the acquisition by Daily Dot Media, Yiannopoulos stepped down as editor-in-chief, although he remained an adviser to the company.[25][26] In 2014 Yiannopoulos started writing for Breitbart,[27] and in October 2015, the Breitbart News Network placed Yiannopoulos in charge of its new \"Breitbart Tech\" section. The site had six full-time staff, including an eSports specialist, and was edited by Yiannopoulos until his resignation on 21 February 2017.[28] In 2014 Yiannopoulos emerged as a \"lead actor\" in the Gamergate controversy through his work at Breitbart,[29] becoming one of the most vocal of Gamergate's supporters.[30] Yiannopoulos employed Gamergate as a basis for online attacks on women,[31] and his role in Gamergate allowed him to become one of the central figures in the mainstream growth of the alt-right.[32] Much of the work at Breitbart which brought Yiannopoulos to national attention was inspired by the ideas of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In early October 2017, BuzzFeed News published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the alt-right and neo-Nazi movements. Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were Curtis Yarvin, a central figure of the neoreactionary movement; Devin Saucier, the editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance; Andrew Auernheimer, the administrator of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer; and Baked Alaska, a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.[3] The story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with anti-semitic overtones, such as 'Kristall', a reference to Kristallnacht and 'longknives1290', a compound reference to the Night of the Long Knives and the Edict of Expulsion.[3] In a Breitbart article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as \"dangerously bright\". The Tablet stated that many of these intellectual backers write for publications it describes as racist and antisemitic, such as VDARE and American Renaissance. The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.[33] The Anti-Defamation League classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the alt-lite; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly white nationalist and anti-semitic.[34] These accusations, as well as Yiannopoulos's support for Trump, have contributed to a feud between Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro, a Jewish conservative political commentator who refused to support Trump in the 2016 election. Shapiro accused Yiannopoulos, his followers, and other Trump supporters of racist and anti-Semitic behaviour. He criticized Yiannopoulos's attempts to distinguish between real racist or bigoted behaviour and trolling, stating that \"words have meaning\" and that the distinction that Yiannopoulos was attempting to make \"simply doesn\u2019t exist in objective reality\".[35] in 2017, Yiannopoulos was caught on camera singing \"America the Beautiful\" at a karaoke bar, where a crowd of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, including Richard B. Spencer, who cheered him with the Nazi sieg heil salute. Yiannopoulos has subsequently claimed that he did not see the Nazi salutes while he was singing, citing what he claimed to be \"extreme myopia\". According to the bartender who was working on the night of the incident, Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and their entourage came into the bar and asked to sing karaoke even though it had ended. When the bartender saw the Nazi salutes she rushed the stage and told Yiannopoulos and his friends to leave, at which point they began harassing her, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and \"Make America Great Again!\" According to her, Yiannopoulos was getting the others \"roused\".[36] Following these revelations, billionaire Robert Mercer ceased his support for Yiannopoulous and condemned him,[37] as did Yiannopoulous's former employer Steve Bannon.[38] In November 2019, Yiannopoulos released an audio-recording which appeared to feature Richard Spencer using using racist slurs against African Americans and Jewish people. The recording appeared to date from the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the murder of Heather Heyer. [39] Yiannopoulos has done a number of controversial tours. Beginning in 2015 with the \"The Dangerous Faggot Tour\", encompassing universities in the United States and Great Britain. Although few of his American speeches were cancelled, many were met with notable protest ranging from vocal disruptions to violent demonstrations. Yiannopoulos has also had visas denied or cancelled on a number of occasions.[40][41][42][43] In January 2017, Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington. The event sparked large protests.[44] A 34-year-old man was shot while protesting and suffered life-threatening injuries. A witness recalled seeing someone release pepper spray in the crowd, which triggered the shooting confrontation.[45] On 1 February 2017, Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make a speech at UC Berkeley at 8:00\u00a0pm. More than 100 UC Berkeley faculty had signed a petition urging the university to cancel the event. Over 1,500 people gathered to protest against the event on the steps of Sproul Hall, with some violence occurring. According to the university, around 150 masked agitators came onto campus and interrupted the protest, setting fires, damaging property, throwing fireworks, attacking members of the crowd, and throwing rocks at the police. These violent protesters included members of BAMN, who threw rocks at police, shattered windows, threw Molotov cocktails, and later vandalised downtown Berkeley. Among those assaulted were a Syrian Muslim in a suit who was pepper sprayed and hit with a rod by a protester who said \"You look like a Nazi\", and a woman who was pepper sprayed while being interviewed by a TV reporter.[46] Citing security concerns, the UC Police Department cancelled the event. One person was arrested for failure to disperse, and there was about $100,000 in damage. The police were criticised for their \"hands off\" policy whereby they did not arrest any of the demonstrators who committed assault, vandalism, or arson.[47][48] Berkeley police reported at least 11 arrests, but no injuries or damage to buildings. UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said afterwards that the media event amounted to \"the most expensive photo op in the university's history.\"[49][50] In November 2017, Yiannopoulos began a tour of Australia, visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Adelaide and Perth. During the Adelaide show, Yiannopoulos stirred controversy by projecting an unflattering photo of the feminist writer Clementine Ford, taken when she was a teenager, with the words \"UNFUCKABLE\" superimposed over the top. During events in Melbourne he again stirred controversy when he described Australian Aboriginal art as \"crap\" and \"really shit\". There was violence outside his Melbourne events as protesters from the left-aligned Campaign Against Racism and Fascism and the right-wing True Blue Crew clashed. Seven people were arrested after clashing with police and outside the venue for Yiannopoulos's Sydney event. Yiannopoulos claimed the violence was caused by \"the left, showing up, being violent to stop freedom of speech\".[51] Yiannopoulos published two poetry books under the name Milo Andreas Wagner. His 2007 release Eskimo Papoose was later scrutinised for re-using lines from pop music and television without attribution, to which he replied that it was done deliberately and the work was satirical.[8] An ghostwritten autobiography titled Dangerous was announced in December 2016. Yiannopoulos reportedly received an $80,000 advance payment from the book's planned publisher, Simon & Schuster.[52] It was intended to be published under their Threshold Editions. A day after its announcement, pre-sales for the book elevated it to first place on Amazon.com's list of best-sellers.[53][54] In February 2017 Simon & Schuster cancelled its plans to publish the book in the wake of the video and sexual-consent comments controversy that also led to CPAC withdrawing its speaking invitation and Yiannopoulos to resign from Breitbart. Yiannopoulos sued Simon & Schuster for 'breach of contract' and 'breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing', seeking $10\u00a0million in damages. He dropped the suit in February 2018.[55] In May 2017, Yiannopoulos announced that he would self-publish the book on 4 July 2017. Soon after the announcement, the book became the best-selling political humour book on Amazon. The book was a New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller. The book further peaked at No. 1 on Publishers Weekly's nonfiction bestseller list and at No. 2 on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list.[56] Subsequent publications Yiannopoulos published the book Diabolical: How Pope Francis Has Betrayed Clerical Abuse Victims Like Me \u2013 and Why He Has to Go in 2018.[57] He stated \u201cThe main purpose of writing this new book was to talk about the homosexual cancer that has infected the Vatican\u2026\u201d The book repeated the discredited claim that paedophilia and homosexuality are linked. Yiannopoulos promoted the book through Michael Voris, a traditionalist Catholic, celibate bisexual and anti-LGBT activist.[58] In 2019, Yiannopoulos published \u201cMiddle Rages: Why The Battle For Medieval Studies Matters To America,\u201d an account of the state of medieval studies as an academic discipline in the United States. The book was covered in a May 2019 New York Times piece.[59] Yiannopoulos's self-published books How to Be Poor and How to Be Straight were also released in 2019. The former was released after the revelation of his alleged insolvency.[60][61] In December 2015, Twitter briefly suspended Yiannopoulos' account after he changed his profile to describe himself as BuzzFeed's \"social justice editor.\" His Twitter account's blue \"verification\" checkmark was removed by the site the following month.[62] Twitter declined to give an explanation for the removal of verification, saying that they do not comment on individual cases. Some news outlets speculated that Yiannopoulos had violated its speech and harassment codes, as with an instance where he told another user that they \"deserved to be harassed.\" Others worried that Twitter was targeting conservatives.[62][63] For his criticism of Islam after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub, his Twitter account was briefly suspended in June 2016. His account was later restored.[64] In July 2016, Yiannopoulos panned the Ghostbusters reboot as \"a movie to help lonely middle-aged women feel better about being left on the shelf.\" After the film's release, Twitter trolls attacked African-American actress Leslie Jones with racist slurs and bigoted commentary. Yiannopoulos wrote three public tweets about Jones, saying \"Ghostbusters is doing so badly they've deployed [Leslie Jones] to play the victim on Twitter,\" before describing her reply to him as \"barely literate\" and then calling her a \"black dude\". Multiple media outlets have described Yiannopoulos' tweets as encouraging the abuse directed at Jones. Yiannopoulos was then permanently banned by Twitter for what the company cited as \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others\". He later stated that he was banned because of his conservative beliefs.[65] In May 2019, Yiannopoulos and several other influential people in politics and culture, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and conspiracy theorists and fellow right-wing pundits Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, were permanently banned from Facebook, which called them \"dangerous.\" \"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,\" a Facebook spokesperson said. \"The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.\"[66] In January 2016, Yiannopoulos set up his Privilege Grant for white men to balance scholarships for women and minorities. He participated in an online telethon to raise money for the grant and in August 2016, reported that approximately $100,000 had been received in donations and a further $250,000 had been pledged. In August 2016, it was revealed that over a quarter of a million dollars had gone missing from the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant. Yiannopoulos apologised for mismanaging the grant and denied speculation he had spent the money. In March 2018, Yiannopoulos confirmed that the fund had been closed down.[67] In February 2017, it was announced that Yiannopoulos would address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). A conservative website, Reagan Battalion, then posted video of 2015 and 2016 clips of YouTube interviews at the request of a 16-year-old Canadian student who was opposed to Yiannopoulos' CPAC address. In the interview in a January 2016 episode of the podcast Drunken Peasants, Yiannopoulos stated that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can \"happen perfectly consensually\", because some 13-year-olds are, in his view, sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults; he spoke favourably both of gay 13-year-old boys having sex with adult men and straight 13-year-old boys having sex with adult women. He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age. He also stated that \"paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature\" but rather that \"paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.\" Later in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: \"I think the age of consent law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them.\"[68] Yiannopoulos subsequently held a press conference, at which he said he had been the victim of child abuse, and that his comments were a way to cope with it. He declined to identify his abusers or discuss the incidents in any detail. He characterised his comments as the \"usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour\", and dismissed the allegation that he endorses child molestation. He alleged that the video had been edited to give a misleading impression, and stated, \"I will not apologise for dealing with my life experiences in the best way that I can, which is humour. No one can tell me or anyone else who has lived through sexual abuse how to deal with those emotions. But I am sorry to other abuse victims if my own personal way of dealing with what happened to me has hurt you.\"[69] In response to the controversy, Simon & Schuster cancelled its plans to publish his autobiography in June 2017. Media outlets reported on 20 February that Breitbart was considering terminating Yiannopoulos' contract as a result of the controversy. Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart on 21 February, reportedly under pressure to do so.[70] Yiannopoulos was later criticized for attending Hollywood \"boat parties\" and \"house parties\" in which boys he described as \"very young \u2013 very young\" were sexually abused, but failing to report the abusers to the authorities or to identify them during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. When asked about this by Ryan Lizza of New York magazine, Yiannopoulos said he \"didn't check anyone's I.D.s.\" and that he \"had no idea what the ages of any of those people at the parties were.\" He stated that when he said \"very young\" he was assuming that they were sixteen or seventeen. He reiterated that he doesn't \"advocate for any illegal behavior\" or excuse it.[71] When, on 10 March, an additional video emerged in which he said on a 2015 episode of Gavin McInnes's show that child sexual abuse is \"really not that big a deal. You can't let it ruin your life,\" Yiannopoulos was criticized for mocking child sexual abuse victims by calling them \"whinging selfish brats\" for \"suddenly\" remembering they were abused, and \"suddenly\" deciding it was a problem, 20 years after the abuse occurred. He also stated that a disproportionate number of paedophiles are homosexual.[72] Commenting again on his child sexual abuse remarks, Yiannopoulos stated, \"I did say something in the course of that conversation that I didn't intend, and for that I apologized.\" He continued, \"I did it incautiously and I did it in sloppy language.\" He did, however add, \"If I want to joke about a priest who did whatever he did to me when I was younger, I'm entitled to do so.\"[73] In 2019, Yiannopoulos wrote an article in The Spectator defending convicted child sex offender and cardinal, George Pell.[74] On 26 June 2018, reports surfaced that Yiannopoulos had told at least two news organisations who had requested comments that he wanted vigilantes to shoot journalists. According to a reporter for the New York Observer, he wrote in a text message \"I can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight\". Two days later, following a shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland in which five people were killed, Yiannopoulos denied that his comments were responsible, adding that his remarks were a joke. He later posted on Instagram that he sent the messages to troll journalists. On Facebook he wrote \"You\u2019re about to see a raft of news stories claiming that I am responsible for inspiring the deaths of journalists.\" and \"The truth, as always, is the opposite of what the media tells you.\"[75] In October 2018, following several instances in which pipe bombs had been sent to prominent Trump critics, Yiannopoulos posted the following comment on Instagram: \"Just catching up with news of all these pipe bombs. Disgusting and sad (that they didn't go off, and the daily beast didn't get one)\". After initially refusing to remove the comment when it was reported as hate speech, Instagram later deleted the post.[76] Yiannopoulos describes himself as a provocateur and \"the most fabulous supervillain on the Internet\" and a \"lovable rogue.\"[73] In the UK, Yiannopoulos supported the Conservative Party before applying to join the UK Independence Party in June 2018.[77] A supporter of Donald Trump, and compared to Ann Coulter, he has been referred to as the \"face of a political movement,\" but he says his real concern is \"pop culture and free speech.\"[4][78] Yiannopoulos is a frequent critic of Islam. Following the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, he claimed that all of Islam, not simply a small group of radicals, was responsible for mistreating women and homosexuals.[79] Yiannopoulos described social attitudes of Western Muslims as \"horribly regressive.\" He has attempted to distinguish his opposition to Muslim immigration into the West from racism.[80] After the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, Yiannopoulos said that he condemned the violence but wrote on Facebook that attacks like that happen \"because the establishment panders to and mollycoddles extremist leftism and barbaric, alien religious cultures.\" He was widely criticized for this description and banned from making an intended speaking tour in Australia in 2019.[81][40] Yiannapoulos is a frequent critic of feminism and \"dumpy lesbians.\" He has frequently written articles that have been criticised as misogynistic. In a Breitbart article titled, \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\", he asserts that the combined oral contraceptive pill causes women to become hysterical, sexually promiscuous and obese. He declared his birthday \"World Patriarchy Day\". In 2016, Yiannapoulos published a Breitbart article entitled, \"Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism Or Cancer?\" [4][82] [83][10] He describes feminists as \"easy to wind up\", is critical of the idea of a gender pay gap and claims that feminism \" has become \"a mean, vindictive, sociopathic, man-hating movement.\"[82] Yiannopoulos favours banning women from military combat units.[84] In January 2018, Yiannopoulos reported a fictitious news story, written by a spoof news-site, as being true. The article claimed that an English High Court had ruled that the National Health Service was legally obliged to offer cervical smear tests to men. Unaware that the story was satire, Yiannopoulos argued that the story exemplified the thinking of those living in 'feminist clown world'. Before reading out the article verbatim, Yiannopoulos insisted that he had researched the story and promised that 'this is real, I haven't just made this up'.[85] While Yiannopoulos is openly gay, he has described being gay as \"a lifestyle choice guaranteed to bring [gay people] pain and unhappiness.\"[86] In October 2017, he married his husband in Hawaii. That same month, he came out against the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, arguing it would violate religious freedom.[84][87][88] In 2017, Yiannopoulos reiterated his belief that homosexuality is a sin and denounced those (including clergy) who sought to change Church dogma on the issue. \"You don't see me disputing the Church's teachings on homosexuality...I wouldn't dream of demanding that the Church throw away her hard truths just to lie to me in hopes I\u2019ll feel better about myself,\" he said.[89] In August 2019, Yiannopoulos was grand marshal for a straight pride parade in Boston, organized by the far-right group Resist Marxism. The parade was ostensibly to celebrate heterosexuality.[90][91][92] In July 2019, during an interview with The Jewish Journal, Yiannopoulos described himself as a Zionist who believed Israel is a bastion of civilization in a region of Islamic tyrants. During the interview, Yiannopoulos advocated for a Jewish \"super-state\" in the Middle East, and endorsed Israeli and American forces \"assassinating every leader of Hamas\".[93] In 2009, Yiannopoulos organised the London Nude Tech Calendar, which is a calendar featuring members of the London technology scene for the purpose to raise money for an organisation called Take Heart India.[94] Yiannopoulos hosted an event known as the Young Rewired State competition in 2010, which is an initiative to showcase the technological talents of 15\u201318-year-olds.[95] In December 2018, The Guardian reported that documents assembled by his former Australian tour promoters, Australian Events Management, showed Yiannopoulos had accrued more than $2\u00a0million in unpaid debt. Yiannopoulos reportedly owed $1.6\u00a0million to his own company, $400,000 to the Mercer Family Foundation, $153,215 to his former lawyers, $76,574 to former collaborator and Breitbart writer Allum Bokhari, and $20,000 to the luxury brand Cartier.[96]",

Yiannopoulos is a former editor for Breitbart News and describes himself as a \"cultural libertarian\". Through his speeches and writings, he ridicules Islam, feminism, social justice, and political correctness.[9][10][11] Leaked emails have shown that Yiannopoulous's book, Dangerous, and many of his Breitbart articles were ghost-written by a Breitbart colleague.[12]\nYiannopoulos worked for Breitbart from 2014 until 2017. During his time at Breitbart Yiannopoulos rose to prominence as a significant voice in the Gamergate controversy. In July 2016, he was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment.[13][14] He was permanently banned from Facebook in 2019.[15][16]\nAccording to hundreds of emails by Yiannopoulous leaked by Buzzfeed in late 2017, Yiannopoulos repeatedly solicited white nationalists, such as American Renaissance editor Devin Saucier, for story ideas and editing suggestions during his tenure at Breitbart.[12] The emails show that this was an effort to appeal to a racist readership through dog-whistling.\nYiannopoulos has been accused of being an apologist for or supporting paedophilia. The allegation arose from several video clips in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be \"perfectly consensual\" and positive experiences for the boys.[17] Following the release of the video, Yiannopoulos was forced out of his position at Breitbart, his invitation to speak before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was revoked, and a contract to publish his autobiography with Simon &amp; Schuster was cancelled. Yiannopoulos has said that he is not a supporter of paedophilic relationships and that his statements were merely attempts to cope with his own victimhood, as an object of child abuse by unnamed older men.\nBorn as Milo Hanrahan, Yiannopoulos was  born and raised in  Chatham,  Kent, England.[18] His father is of half-Greek and half-Irish descent. His parents divorced when he was a boy.[19][4][4]\nRaised by his mother and her second husband, Yiannopoulos has stated that he did not have a good relationship with his stepfather and has spoken of how his stepfather would beat him. He is described as a practising Roman Catholic, but has also said that he is Jewish; Yiannopoulos states his maternal grandmother was Jewish. As a teenager, Yiannopoulos lived with his paternal grandmother whose surname he later adopted.[20]\nYiannopoulos was educated at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury from which he has said he was expelled. He attended the University of Manchester but dropped out before graduating; he then read English at Wolfson College, Cambridge, but was sent down (expelled) in 2010.[21]\nIn 2017, Yiannopoulos was a U.S. resident alien on O-1 visa status. He married his long-term boyfriend in Hawaii, in September 2017. The couple prefer at present to keep the identity of his husband secret.[22]\nAfter he dropped out of university, Yiannopoulos initially secured a job at The Catholic Herald. In 2009, Yiannopoulos moved to technology journalism with The Daily Telegraph.[23]\nIn November 2011, Yiannopoulos co-founded The Kernel.[24] In March, 2013, The Kernel was shut down amidst allegations of unpaid wages, at a time when Yiannopoulos was the Editor-in-Chief and sole director of the parent company, Sentinel Media.[9] It was reopened later that year under Kernel Media, with Yiannopoulos remaining Editor-in-Chief and having privately settled the previous debts.[24]\nIn 2014, The Kernel was acquired by Daily Dot Media, the parent company of The Daily Dot. After the acquisition by Daily Dot Media, Yiannopoulos stepped down as editor-in-chief, although he remained an adviser to the company.[25][26]\nIn 2014 Yiannopoulos started writing for Breitbart,[27] and in October 2015, the Breitbart News Network placed Yiannopoulos in charge of its new \"Breitbart Tech\" section. The site had six full-time staff, including an eSports specialist, and was edited by Yiannopoulos until his resignation on 21 February 2017.[28]\nIn 2014 Yiannopoulos emerged as a \"lead actor\" in the Gamergate controversy through his work at Breitbart,[29] becoming one of the most vocal of Gamergate's supporters.[30] Yiannopoulos employed Gamergate as a basis for online attacks on women,[31] and his role in Gamergate allowed him to become one of the central figures in the mainstream growth of the alt-right.[32]\nMuch of the work at Breitbart which brought Yiannopoulos to national attention was inspired by the ideas of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In early October 2017, BuzzFeed News published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the alt-right and neo-Nazi movements. Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were Curtis Yarvin, a central figure of the neoreactionary movement; Devin Saucier, the editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance; Andrew Auernheimer, the administrator of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer; and Baked Alaska, a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.[3]\nThe story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with anti-semitic overtones, such as 'Kristall', a reference to Kristallnacht and 'longknives1290', a compound reference to the Night of the Long Knives and the Edict of Expulsion.[3]\nIn a Breitbart article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as \"dangerously bright\". The Tablet stated that many of these intellectual backers write for publications it describes as racist and antisemitic, such as VDARE and American Renaissance. The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.[33]\nThe Anti-Defamation League classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the alt-lite; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly white nationalist and anti-semitic.[34] These accusations, as well as Yiannopoulos's support for Trump, have contributed to a feud between Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro, a Jewish conservative political commentator who refused to support Trump in the 2016 election. Shapiro accused Yiannopoulos, his followers, and other Trump supporters of racist and anti-Semitic behaviour. He criticized Yiannopoulos's attempts to distinguish between real racist or bigoted behaviour and trolling, stating that \"words have meaning\" and that the distinction that Yiannopoulos was attempting to make \"simply doesn\u2019t exist in objective reality\".[35]\nin 2017, Yiannopoulos was caught on camera singing \"America the Beautiful\" at a karaoke bar, where a crowd of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, including Richard B. Spencer, who cheered him with the Nazi sieg heil salute. Yiannopoulos has subsequently claimed that he did not see the Nazi salutes while he was singing, citing what he claimed to be \"extreme myopia\". According to the bartender who was working on the night of the incident, Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and their entourage came into the bar and asked to sing karaoke even though it had ended. When the bartender saw the Nazi salutes she rushed the stage and told Yiannopoulos and his friends to leave, at which point they began harassing her, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and \"Make America Great Again!\" According to her, Yiannopoulos was getting the others \"roused\".[36]\nFollowing these revelations, billionaire Robert Mercer ceased his support for Yiannopoulous and condemned him,[37] as did Yiannopoulous's former employer Steve Bannon.[38]\nIn November 2019, Yiannopoulos released an audio-recording which appeared to feature Richard Spencer using using racist slurs against African Americans and Jewish people. The recording appeared to date from the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the murder of Heather Heyer.\n[39]\nYiannopoulos has done a number of controversial tours. Beginning in 2015 with the \"The Dangerous Faggot Tour\", encompassing universities in the United States and Great Britain. Although few of his American speeches were cancelled, many were met with notable protest ranging from vocal disruptions to violent demonstrations. Yiannopoulos has also had visas denied or cancelled on a number of occasions.[40][41][42][43]\nIn January 2017, Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington. The event sparked large protests.[44] A 34-year-old man was shot while protesting and suffered life-threatening injuries. A witness recalled seeing someone release pepper spray in the crowd, which triggered the shooting confrontation.[45]\nOn 1 February 2017, Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make a speech at UC Berkeley at 8:00\u00a0pm. More than 100 UC Berkeley faculty had signed a petition urging the university to cancel the event. Over 1,500 people gathered to protest against the event on the steps of Sproul Hall, with some violence occurring. According to the university, around 150 masked agitators came onto campus and interrupted the protest, setting fires, damaging property, throwing fireworks, attacking members of the crowd, and throwing rocks at the police. These violent protesters included members of BAMN, who threw rocks at police, shattered windows, threw Molotov cocktails, and later vandalised downtown Berkeley. Among those assaulted were a Syrian Muslim in a suit who was pepper sprayed and hit with a rod by a protester who said \"You look like a Nazi\", and a woman who was pepper sprayed while being interviewed by a TV reporter.[46] Citing security concerns, the UC Police Department cancelled the event. One person was arrested for failure to disperse, and there was about $100,000 in damage. The police were criticised for their \"hands off\" policy whereby they did not arrest any of the demonstrators who committed assault, vandalism, or arson.[47][48] Berkeley police reported at least 11 arrests, but no injuries or damage to buildings. UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said afterwards that the media event amounted to \"the most expensive photo op in the university's history.\"[49][50]\nIn November 2017, Yiannopoulos began a tour of Australia, visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Adelaide and Perth. During the Adelaide show, Yiannopoulos stirred controversy by projecting an unflattering photo of the feminist writer Clementine Ford, taken when she was a teenager, with the words \"UNFUCKABLE\" superimposed over the top. During events in Melbourne he again stirred controversy when he described Australian Aboriginal art as \"crap\" and \"really shit\". There was violence outside his Melbourne events as protesters from the left-aligned Campaign Against Racism and Fascism and the right-wing True Blue Crew clashed.  Seven people were arrested after clashing with police and outside the venue for Yiannopoulos's Sydney event. Yiannopoulos claimed the violence was caused by \"the left, showing up, being violent to stop freedom of speech\".[51]\nYiannopoulos published two poetry books under the name Milo Andreas Wagner. His 2007 release Eskimo Papoose was later scrutinised for re-using lines from pop music and television without attribution, to which he replied that it was done deliberately and the work was satirical.[8]\nAn ghostwritten  autobiography titled Dangerous was announced in December 2016. Yiannopoulos reportedly received an $80,000  advance payment from the book's planned publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster.[52] It was intended to be published under their Threshold Editions. A day after its announcement, pre-sales for the book elevated it to first place on Amazon.com's list of best-sellers.[53][54]\nIn February 2017 Simon &amp; Schuster cancelled its plans to publish the book in the wake of the video and sexual-consent comments controversy that also led to CPAC withdrawing its speaking invitation and Yiannopoulos to resign from Breitbart. Yiannopoulos sued Simon &amp; Schuster for 'breach of contract' and 'breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing', seeking $10\u00a0million in damages. He dropped the suit in February 2018.[55]\nIn May 2017, Yiannopoulos announced that he would self-publish the book on 4 July 2017. Soon after the announcement, the book became the best-selling political humour book on Amazon. The book was a New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller. The book further peaked at No. 1 on Publishers Weekly's nonfiction bestseller list and at No. 2 on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list.[56]\nSubsequent publications\nYiannopoulos published the book Diabolical: How Pope Francis Has Betrayed Clerical Abuse Victims Like Me \u2013 and Why He Has to Go  in 2018.[57] He stated \u201cThe main purpose of writing this new book was to talk about the homosexual cancer that has infected the Vatican\u2026\u201d The book repeated the  discredited claim that paedophilia and homosexuality are linked. Yiannopoulos promoted the book through Michael Voris, a traditionalist Catholic, celibate bisexual and anti-LGBT activist.[58]\nIn 2019, Yiannopoulos published \u201cMiddle Rages: Why The Battle For Medieval Studies Matters To America,\u201d an account of the state of medieval studies as an academic discipline in the United States. The book was covered in a May 2019 New York Times piece.[59]\nYiannopoulos's self-published books How to Be Poor and How to Be Straight were also released in 2019. The former was released after the revelation of his alleged insolvency.[60][61]\nIn December 2015, Twitter briefly suspended Yiannopoulos' account after he changed his profile to describe himself as BuzzFeed's \"social justice editor.\" His Twitter account's blue \"verification\" checkmark was removed by the site the following month.[62] Twitter declined to give an explanation for the removal of verification, saying that they do not comment on individual cases. Some news outlets speculated that Yiannopoulos had violated its speech and harassment codes, as with an instance where he told another user that they \"deserved to be harassed.\" Others worried that Twitter was targeting conservatives.[62][63]\nFor his criticism of Islam after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub, his Twitter account was briefly suspended in June 2016. His account was later restored.[64]\nIn July 2016, Yiannopoulos panned the Ghostbusters reboot as \"a movie to help lonely middle-aged women feel better about being left on the shelf.\" After the film's release, Twitter trolls attacked African-American actress Leslie Jones with racist slurs and bigoted commentary. Yiannopoulos wrote three public tweets about Jones, saying \"Ghostbusters is doing so badly they've deployed [Leslie Jones] to play the victim on Twitter,\" before describing her reply to him as \"barely literate\" and then calling her a \"black dude\". Multiple media outlets have described Yiannopoulos' tweets as encouraging the abuse directed at Jones. Yiannopoulos was then permanently banned by Twitter for what the company cited as \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others\". He later stated that he was banned because of his conservative beliefs.[65]\nIn May 2019, Yiannopoulos and several other influential people in politics and culture, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and conspiracy theorists and fellow right-wing pundits Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, were permanently banned from Facebook, which called them \"dangerous.\" \"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,\" a Facebook spokesperson said. \"The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.\"[66]\nIn January 2016, Yiannopoulos set up his Privilege Grant for white men to balance scholarships for women and minorities. He participated in an online telethon to raise money for the grant and in August 2016, reported that approximately $100,000 had been received in donations and a further $250,000 had been pledged.\nIn August 2016, it was revealed that over a quarter of a million dollars had gone missing from the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant. Yiannopoulos apologised for mismanaging the grant and denied speculation he had spent the money. In March 2018, Yiannopoulos confirmed that the fund had been closed down.[67]\nIn February 2017, it was announced that Yiannopoulos would address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). A conservative website, Reagan Battalion, then posted video of 2015 and 2016 clips of YouTube interviews at the request of a 16-year-old Canadian student who was opposed to Yiannopoulos' CPAC address.\nIn the interview in a January 2016 episode of the podcast Drunken Peasants, Yiannopoulos stated that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can \"happen perfectly consensually\", because some 13-year-olds are, in his view, sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults; he spoke favourably both of gay 13-year-old boys having sex with adult men and straight 13-year-old boys having sex with adult women. He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age. He also stated that \"paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature\" but rather that \"paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.\" Later in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: \"I think the age of consent law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them.\"[68]\nYiannopoulos subsequently held a press conference, at which he said he had been the victim of child abuse, and that his comments were a way to cope with it. He declined to identify his abusers or discuss the incidents in any detail. He characterised his comments as the \"usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour\", and dismissed the allegation that he endorses child molestation. He alleged that the video had been edited to give a misleading impression, and stated, \"I will not apologise for dealing with my life experiences in the best way that I can, which is humour. No one can tell me or anyone else who has lived through sexual abuse how to deal with those emotions. But I am sorry to other abuse victims if my own personal way of dealing with what happened to me has hurt you.\"[69] In response to the controversy, Simon &amp; Schuster cancelled its plans to publish his autobiography in June 2017. Media outlets reported on 20 February that Breitbart was considering terminating Yiannopoulos' contract as a result of the controversy. Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart on 21 February, reportedly under pressure to do so.[70]\nYiannopoulos was later criticized for attending Hollywood \"boat parties\" and \"house parties\" in which boys he described as \"very young \u2013 very young\" were sexually abused, but failing to report the abusers to the authorities or to identify them during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. When asked about this by Ryan Lizza of New York magazine, Yiannopoulos said he \"didn't check anyone's I.D.s.\" and that he \"had no idea what the ages of any of those people at the parties were.\" He stated that when he said \"very young\" he was assuming that they were sixteen or seventeen. He reiterated that he doesn't \"advocate for any illegal behavior\" or excuse it.[71] When, on 10 March, an additional video emerged in which he said on a 2015 episode of Gavin McInnes's show that child sexual abuse is \"really not that big a deal. You can't let it ruin your life,\" Yiannopoulos was criticized for mocking child sexual abuse victims by calling them \"whinging selfish brats\" for \"suddenly\" remembering they were abused, and \"suddenly\" deciding it was a problem, 20 years after the abuse occurred. He also stated that a disproportionate number of paedophiles are homosexual.[72]\nCommenting again on his child sexual abuse remarks, Yiannopoulos stated, \"I did say something in the course of that conversation that I didn't intend, and for that I apologized.\" He continued, \"I did it incautiously and I did it in sloppy language.\" He did, however add, \"If I want to joke about a priest who did whatever he did to me when I was younger, I'm entitled to do so.\"[73]\nIn 2019, Yiannopoulos wrote an article in The Spectator defending convicted child sex offender and cardinal, George Pell.[74]\nOn 26 June 2018, reports surfaced that Yiannopoulos had told at least two news organisations who had requested comments that he wanted vigilantes to shoot journalists. According to a reporter for the New York Observer, he wrote in a text message \"I can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight\". Two days later, following a shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland in which five people were killed, Yiannopoulos denied that his comments were responsible, adding that his remarks were a joke. He later posted on Instagram that he sent the messages to troll journalists. On Facebook he wrote \"You\u2019re about to see a raft of news stories claiming that I am responsible for inspiring the deaths of journalists.\" and \"The truth, as always, is the opposite of what the media tells you.\"[75]\nIn October 2018, following several instances in which pipe bombs had been sent to prominent Trump critics, Yiannopoulos posted the following comment on Instagram: \"Just catching up with news of all these pipe bombs. Disgusting and sad (that they didn't go off, and the daily beast didn't get one)\". After initially refusing to remove the comment when it was reported as hate speech, Instagram later deleted the post.[76]\nYiannopoulos describes himself as a provocateur and \"the most fabulous supervillain on the Internet\" and a \"lovable rogue.\"[73]\nIn the UK,  Yiannopoulos supported the Conservative Party before applying to join the UK Independence Party in June 2018.[77] A supporter of Donald Trump, and compared to Ann Coulter, he has been referred to as the \"face of a political movement,\" but he says his real concern is \"pop culture and free speech.\"[4][78]\nYiannopoulos is a frequent critic of Islam. Following the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, he claimed that all of Islam, not simply a small group of radicals, was responsible for mistreating women and homosexuals.[79]\nYiannopoulos described social attitudes of Western Muslims as \"horribly regressive.\" He has attempted to distinguish his opposition to Muslim immigration into the West from racism.[80] After the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, Yiannopoulos said that he condemned the violence but wrote on Facebook that attacks like that happen \"because the establishment panders to and mollycoddles extremist leftism and barbaric, alien religious cultures.\" He was widely criticized for this description and banned from making an intended speaking tour in Australia in 2019.[81][40]\nYiannapoulos is a frequent critic of feminism and \"dumpy lesbians.\" He has frequently written articles that have been criticised as misogynistic. In a Breitbart article titled, \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\", he asserts that the combined oral contraceptive pill causes women to become hysterical, sexually promiscuous and obese. He declared his birthday \"World Patriarchy Day\". In 2016, Yiannapoulos published a Breitbart article entitled, \"Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism Or Cancer?\"\n[4][82]\n[83][10]\nHe describes feminists as \"easy to wind up\", is critical of the idea of a gender pay gap and claims that feminism \" has become \"a mean, vindictive, sociopathic, man-hating movement.\"[82] Yiannopoulos favours banning women from military combat units.[84]\nIn January 2018, Yiannopoulos reported a fictitious news story, written by a spoof news-site, as being true. The article claimed that an English High Court had ruled that the National Health Service was legally obliged to offer cervical smear tests to men. Unaware that the story was satire, Yiannopoulos argued that the story exemplified the thinking of those living in 'feminist clown world'. Before reading out the article verbatim, Yiannopoulos insisted that he had researched the story and promised that 'this is real, I haven't just made this up'.[85]\nWhile Yiannopoulos is openly gay, he has described being gay as \"a lifestyle choice guaranteed to bring [gay people] pain and unhappiness.\"[86]\nIn October 2017, he married his husband in Hawaii. That same month, he came out against the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, arguing it would violate religious freedom.[84][87][88]\nIn 2017, Yiannopoulos reiterated his belief that homosexuality is a sin and denounced those (including clergy) who sought to change Church dogma on the issue. \"You don't see me disputing the Church's teachings on homosexuality...I wouldn't dream of demanding that the Church throw away her hard truths just to lie to me in hopes I\u2019ll feel better about myself,\" he said.[89]\nIn August 2019, Yiannopoulos was grand marshal for a straight pride parade in Boston, organized by the far-right group Resist Marxism. The parade was ostensibly to celebrate heterosexuality.[90][91][92]\nIn July 2019, during an interview with The Jewish Journal, Yiannopoulos described himself as a Zionist who believed Israel is a bastion of civilization in a region of Islamic tyrants. During the interview, Yiannopoulos advocated for a Jewish \"super-state\" in the Middle East, and endorsed Israeli and American forces \"assassinating every leader of Hamas\".[93]\nIn 2009, Yiannopoulos organised the London Nude Tech Calendar, which is a calendar featuring members of the London technology scene for the purpose to raise money for an organisation called Take Heart India.[94]\nYiannopoulos hosted an event known as the Young Rewired State competition in 2010, which is an initiative to showcase the technological talents of 15\u201318-year-olds.[95]\nIn December 2018, The Guardian reported that documents assembled by his former Australian tour promoters, Australian Events Management, showed Yiannopoulos had accrued more than $2\u00a0million in unpaid debt. Yiannopoulos reportedly owed $1.6\u00a0million to his own company, $400,000 to the Mercer Family Foundation, $153,215 to his former lawyers, $76,574 to former collaborator and Breitbart writer Allum Bokhari, and $20,000 to the luxury brand Cartier.[96]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJordan Bernt Peterson (born June 12, 1962) is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology,[1] with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief[2] and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.[3] Peterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant professor in the psychology department.[4][5] In 1998, he returned to Canada to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where he eventually became a full professor.[6] Peterson's first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide.[7][8][9] His second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, was published in January 2018.[4][10][11] In 2016, Peterson released a series[12] of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16, \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"gender identity and expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,[a][13] which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law,[14][15][16] although legal experts have disagreed.[17] He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.[4][10][11] Several writers have associated Peterson with an \"Intellectual Dark Web\".[18][19][20][21][22] Peterson was born on June 12, 1962.[23] He grew up in Fairview, Alberta, a small town northwest of his birthplace (Edmonton).[24] He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher.[25][26] His middle name is Bernt (/\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r\u0259nt/ BAIR-\u0259nt),[27] after his Norwegian great-grandfather.[28] When Peterson was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley (the mother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th Premier of Alberta).[29] He worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in The Road to Wigan Pier, of \"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\" who \"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich\".[25][30] He left the NDP at age 18.[31] After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature.[2] He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982.[31] Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War, 20th-century European totalitarianism,[2][32] and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,[25] and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[32] He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984.[33] In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.[2][34] From July 1993 to June 1998,[1] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals.[31] Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students.[4] In July 1998, he returned to Canada and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.[1][33] Peterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational,[1] religious, ideological,[2] political, and creativity psychology.[3] Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers[35] and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017.[36] For most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16.[12][29][37] As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017[10] and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018.[26][38] In June 2018, Peterson debated with Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver while moderated by Bret Weinstein, and again in July at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London while moderated by Douglas Murray, over the topic of religion and God.[39][40] In April 2019, Peterson debated professor Slavoj \u017di\u017eek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.[41][42] In 1999 Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.[31][5][43] According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification[31]) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide.[31][5][43] He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\".[43] Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.[4] In 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario.[25][33][44] In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. The work contains abstract ethical principles about life, in a more accessible style than Maps of Meaning.[10][4][11] To promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour.[45][46][47] As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed in the UK by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News which generated considerable attention, as well as popularity for the book.[48][49][50][51] The book topped bestselling lists in Canada, the US, and the United Kingdom.[52][53] As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life.[54] In 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures (\"Personality and Its Transformations\", \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\"[55]) and uploading them to YouTube. His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.8 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018.[37][56] In January 2017, he hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. He used funds received on the crowdfunding website Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016. His funding through Patreon has increased from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017, more than $50,000 by July 2017, and over $80,000 by May 2018.[29][37][57][58] In December 2018, Peterson decided to delete his Patreon account after Patreon's bans of political personalities who were violating Patreon's terms of service regarding hate speech.[59][60] Peterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows.[56][61] In December 2016, Peterson started his own podcast, The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, which has included academic guests such as Camille Paglia, Martin Daly, and James W. Pennebaker.[62] On his YouTube channel he has interviewed Stephen Hicks, Richard J. Haier, and Jonathan Haidt among others.[62] In March 2019, the podcast joined the Westwood One network with Peterson's daughter as a co-host on some episodes.[63] Peterson supported engineer James Damore in his action against Google.[11] In May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,[64] a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Book of Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability.[11] In March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said that the fellowship would give him \"the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months\", and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus.[65] A spokesperson for the University said that there was \"no place\" for anyone who could not uphold the \"inclusive environment\" of the university.[66] After a week, the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt.[67] The Cambridge student union released a statement of relief, considering the invitation \"a political act to ... legitimise figures such as Peterson\" and that his work and views are not \"representative of the student body\".[68] Peterson called the decision a \"deeply unfortunate ... error of judgement\" and expressed regret that the Divinity Faculty had submitted to an \"ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob\".[69][70] In 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises.[71] Titled the Self Authoring Suite,[25] it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.[72][73] The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto.[4] Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students.[73][74] According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.[25] Peterson has characterized himself as a \"classic British liberal\",[32][75][76] and as a \"traditionalist\".[77] He has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing,[56] as, for example, The New York Times has described Peterson as \"conservative-leaning\",[78] and The Washington Post has described him as \"conservative\".[79] Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Yoram Hazony stated, \"The startling success of his elevated arguments for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English-speaking world in a generation.\"[80] Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs opines that Peterson has been seen \"as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected.\"[81] Prominent libertarian socialist intellectual Noam Chomsky has agreed with Robinson's criticism, although he described Peterson as \"far on the right\".[82] Peterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism.[61][83] Writing in the National Post, Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had \"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions\",[84] while in The Spectator, Tim Lott stated Peterson became \"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia\".[32] Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of The Globe and Mail noted: \"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won\".[37] According to his study\u2014conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy\u2014of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \"PC-egalitarianism\" and \"PC-authoritarianism\", which is a manifestation of \"offense sensitivity\".[85] Jason McBride claims Peterson places classical liberals in the first type, and places so-called social justice warriors, who he says \"weaponize compassion\", in the second.[25][2] The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.[85] Peterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe.[37] According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s. In his view the humanities have become corrupt and less reliant on science. Instead of \"intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological conversation\". From his own experience as a professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated about and unaware of the mass exterminations and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by Stalinism and Maoism, which were not given the same attention as fascism and Nazism. He also says that \"instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of relativism and power\".[32][86][87] \u2014\u00a0Peterson, 2017[86] Peterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s[83] have built upon and extended certain core tenets of Marxism and communism while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary Western society without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernist thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at Yale University. He states that certain academics in the humanities:[86] ... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the proletariat, the working class, against the bourgeois, they started to pit the oppressed against the oppressor. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name.... The people who hold this doctrine\u2013this radical, postmodern, communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount\u2013they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well. Peterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories.[50][88][89][90] Peterson says that \"disciplines like women's studies should be defunded\" and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies, and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the neo-Marxist ideology.[91][92][93] He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent peer-review processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations,[94] cult-like behaviour,[92] safe-spaces,[91] and radical left-wing political activism for students.[83] Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses artificial intelligence to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses. He announced in November 2017 that he had temporarily postponed the project as \"it might add excessively to current polarization\".[95][96] Peterson has criticized the use of the term \"white privilege\", stating that \"being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop.\u00a0... [It's] racist in its extreme\".[83] In regard to identity politics, while the \"left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride\", he considers them \"equally dangerous\" and that what should be emphasized instead are individualism and individual responsibility.[97] He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating the concept promotes self-censorship in society and journalism.[98] On September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law\".[29][14] In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada.[14][99] He stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refuses to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun.[15] Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \"directly or indirectly\" as offensive, \"whether intentionally or unintentionally\".[16] Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16.[15] The series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty, and labour unions; critics accused Peterson of \"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\" and of \"fundamentally mischaracterising\" the law.[100][29] Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention.[101][102][103] When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \"it would depend on how they asked me\u00a0[...] If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no\u00a0[...] If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level\".[103] Two months later, the National Post published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill and explained why he publicly made a stand against it: I will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words \"zhe\" and \"zher.\" These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century. I have been studying authoritarianism on the right and the left for 35 years. I wrote a book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, on the topic, which explores how ideologies hijack language and belief. As a result of my studies, I have come to believe that Marxism is a murderous ideology. I believe its practitioners in modern universities should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote such vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas, and for indoctrinating their students with these beliefs. I am therefore not going to mouth Marxist words. That would make me a puppet of the radical left, and that is not going to happen. Period.[104] In response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.[105][29] In February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it.[106] Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage.[107] In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16.[36] A media-relations adviser for SSHRC said, \"Committees assess only the information contained in the application.\"[108] In response, The Rebel Media launched an Indiegogo campaign on Peterson's behalf.[109] The campaign raised C$195,000 by its end on May 6, equivalent to over two years of research funding.[110] In May 2017, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing. He was one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill.[107] In November 2017, Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant in a Wilfrid Laurier University first-year communications course, was censured by her professors for showing a segment of The Agenda, which featured Peterson debating Bill C-16 with another professor, during a classroom discussion about pronouns.[111][112][113] The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \"toxic climate\", being compared to a \"speech by Hitler\",[30] and being itself in violation of Bill C-16.[114] The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized.[115][116][117] The events were criticized by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards[118][119][120] and national newspaper columnists[121][122][123][124] as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors.[125] As of September\u00a02018,[update] Wilfrid Laurier had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech.[126] Peterson has argued that there is an ongoing \"crisis of masculinity\" and \"backlash against masculinity\" in which the \"masculine spirit is under assault\".[24][127][128][129] He has argued that feminism and policies such as no-fault divorce have had adverse effects on gender relations and have destabilized society.[127] He has argued that the left characterises the existing societal hierarchy as an \"oppressive patriarchy\" but \"don\u2019t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.\"[24] Peterson has said that men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that male violence is reduced in societies wherein monogamy is a social norm.[24][127] He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a negative reaction to a push to \"feminize\" men, saying \"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\"[130] He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview where he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap.[131][132] Peterson disputed the contention that the disparity was solely due to sexual discrimination.[132][133][134] Peterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change,[135][136] saying he is \"very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change,\"[137] and that \"[y]ou can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved\".[136][138] Peterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989.[29] They have one daughter and one son.[25][29] In a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a Christian; he responded, \"I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes\".[139] When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist\".[10] Writing for The Spectator, Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said that Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.[32] Starting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings.[30] The paintings are displayed in his house as a reminder of the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror.[4][38] In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ('Great Seeker').[30][140] In late 2016, Peterson went on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables to control severe depression and an autoimmune disorder, including psoriasis and uveitis.[26][141] In mid 2018 he stopped eating vegetables, and continued eating only beef (see carnivore diet).[142] In 2019, Peterson entered a rehabilitation facility after experiencing symptoms of physical withdrawal when he stopped taking clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug. He had begun taking the drug upon his doctor's recommendation following his wife's cancer diagnosis.[143][144][145]",

His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology,[1] with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief[2] and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.[3]\nPeterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant professor in the psychology department.[4][5] In 1998, he returned to Canada to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where he eventually became a full professor.[6]\nPeterson's first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide.[7][8][9] His second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, was published in January 2018.[4][10][11]\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series[12] of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16, \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"gender identity and expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,[a][13] which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law,[14][15][16] although legal experts have disagreed.[17] He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.[4][10][11] Several writers have associated Peterson with an \"Intellectual Dark Web\".[18][19][20][21][22]\nPeterson was born on June 12, 1962.[23] He grew up in Fairview, Alberta, a small town northwest of his birthplace (Edmonton).[24] He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher.[25][26] His middle name is Bernt (/\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r\u0259nt/ BAIR-\u0259nt),[27] after his Norwegian great-grandfather.[28]\nWhen Peterson was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley (the mother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th Premier of Alberta).[29] He worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in The Road to Wigan Pier, of \"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\" who \"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich\".[25][30] He left the NDP at age 18.[31]\nAfter graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature.[2] He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982.[31] Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War, 20th-century European totalitarianism,[2][32] and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,[25] and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[32] He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984.[33] In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.[2][34]\nFrom July 1993 to June 1998,[1] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals.[31] Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students.[4] In July 1998, he returned to Canada and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.[1][33]\nPeterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational,[1] religious, ideological,[2] political, and creativity psychology.[3] Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers[35] and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017.[36]\nFor most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16.[12][29][37] As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017[10] and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018.[26][38]\nIn June 2018, Peterson debated with Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver while moderated by Bret Weinstein, and again in July at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London while moderated by Douglas Murray, over the topic of religion and God.[39][40] In April 2019, Peterson debated professor Slavoj \u017di\u017eek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.[41][42]\nIn 1999 Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.[31][5][43]\nAccording to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification[31]) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide.[31][5][43] He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\".[43] Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.[4]\nIn 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario.[25][33][44]\nIn January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. The work contains abstract ethical principles about life, in a more accessible style than Maps of Meaning.[10][4][11]\nTo promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour.[45][46][47] As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed in the UK by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News which generated considerable attention, as well as popularity for the book.[48][49][50][51] The book topped bestselling lists in Canada, the US, and the United Kingdom.[52][53] As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life.[54]\nIn 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures (\"Personality and Its Transformations\", \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\"[55]) and uploading them to YouTube. His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.8 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018.[37][56] In January 2017, he hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. He used funds received on the crowdfunding website Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016. His funding through Patreon has increased from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017, more than $50,000 by July 2017, and over $80,000 by May 2018.[29][37][57][58] In December 2018, Peterson decided to delete his Patreon account after Patreon's bans of political personalities who were violating Patreon's terms of service regarding hate speech.[59][60]\nPeterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows.[56][61] In December 2016, Peterson started his own podcast, The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, which has included academic guests such as Camille Paglia, Martin Daly, and James W. Pennebaker.[62] On his YouTube channel he has interviewed Stephen Hicks, Richard J. Haier, and Jonathan Haidt among others.[62] In March 2019, the podcast joined the Westwood One network with Peterson's daughter as a co-host on some episodes.[63] Peterson supported engineer James Damore in his action against Google.[11]\nIn May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,[64] a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Book of Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability.[11]\nIn March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said that the fellowship would give him \"the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months\", and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus.[65] A spokesperson for the University said that there was \"no place\" for anyone who could not uphold the \"inclusive environment\" of the university.[66] After a week, the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt.[67] The Cambridge student union released a statement of relief, considering the invitation \"a political act to ... legitimise figures such as Peterson\" and that his work and views are not \"representative of the student body\".[68] Peterson called the decision a \"deeply unfortunate ... error of judgement\" and expressed regret that the Divinity Faculty had submitted to an \"ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob\".[69][70]\nIn 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises.[71] Titled the Self Authoring Suite,[25] it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.[72][73] The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto.[4] Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students.[73][74] According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.[25]\nPeterson has characterized himself as a \"classic British liberal\",[32][75][76] and as a \"traditionalist\".[77] He has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing,[56] as, for example, The New York Times has described Peterson as \"conservative-leaning\",[78] and The Washington Post has described him as \"conservative\".[79] Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Yoram Hazony stated, \"The startling success of his elevated arguments for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English-speaking world in a generation.\"[80] Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs opines that Peterson has been seen \"as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected.\"[81] Prominent libertarian socialist intellectual Noam Chomsky has agreed with Robinson's criticism, although he described Peterson as \"far on the right\".[82]\nPeterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism.[61][83]\nWriting in the National Post, Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had \"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions\",[84] while in The Spectator, Tim Lott stated Peterson became \"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia\".[32] Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of The Globe and Mail noted: \"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won\".[37]\nAccording to his study\u2014conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy\u2014of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \"PC-egalitarianism\" and \"PC-authoritarianism\", which is a manifestation of \"offense sensitivity\".[85] Jason McBride claims Peterson places classical liberals in the first type, and places so-called social justice warriors, who he says \"weaponize compassion\", in the second.[25][2] The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.[85]\nPeterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe.[37] According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s.  In his view the humanities  have become corrupt and less reliant on science. Instead of \"intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological  conversation\". From his own experience as a  professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated about and unaware of the mass exterminations and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by Stalinism and Maoism, which were not given the same attention as fascism and Nazism. He also says that \"instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of relativism and power\".[32][86][87]\n \u2014\u00a0Peterson, 2017[86]\nPeterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s[83] have built upon and extended certain core tenets of Marxism and communism while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary Western society without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernist thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at Yale University. He states that certain academics in the humanities:[86]\n... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the proletariat, the working class, against the bourgeois, they started to pit the oppressed against the oppressor. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name.... The people who hold this doctrine\u2013this radical, postmodern, communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount\u2013they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well.\nPeterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories.[50][88][89][90]\nPeterson says that \"disciplines like women's studies should be defunded\" and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies, and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the neo-Marxist ideology.[91][92][93] He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent peer-review processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations,[94] cult-like behaviour,[92] safe-spaces,[91] and radical left-wing political activism for students.[83] Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses artificial intelligence to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses. He announced in November 2017 that he had temporarily postponed the project as \"it might add excessively to current polarization\".[95][96]\nPeterson has criticized the use of the term \"white privilege\", stating that \"being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop.\u00a0... [It's] racist in its extreme\".[83] In regard to identity politics, while the \"left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride\", he considers them \"equally dangerous\" and that what should be emphasized instead are individualism and individual responsibility.[97] He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating the concept promotes self-censorship in society and journalism.[98]\nOn September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law\".[29][14] In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada.[14][99]\nHe stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refuses to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun.[15] Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \"directly or indirectly\" as offensive, \"whether intentionally or unintentionally\".[16] Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16.[15]\nThe series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty, and labour unions; critics accused Peterson of \"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\" and of \"fundamentally mischaracterising\" the law.[100][29] Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention.[101][102][103] When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \"it would depend on how they asked me\u00a0[...] If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no\u00a0[...] If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level\".[103] Two months later, the National Post published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill and explained why he publicly made a stand against it:\nI will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words \"zhe\" and \"zher.\" These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century.\nI have been studying authoritarianism on the right and the left for 35 years. I wrote a book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, on the topic, which explores how ideologies hijack language and belief. As a result of my studies, I have come to believe that Marxism is a murderous ideology. I believe its practitioners in modern universities should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote such vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas, and for indoctrinating their students with these beliefs. I am therefore not going to mouth Marxist words. That would make me a puppet of the radical left, and that is not going to happen. Period.[104]\nIn response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.[105][29]\nIn February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it.[106] Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage.[107] In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16.[36] A media-relations adviser for SSHRC said, \"Committees assess only the information contained in the application.\"[108] In response, The Rebel Media launched an Indiegogo campaign on Peterson's behalf.[109] The campaign raised C$195,000 by its end on May 6, equivalent to over two years of research funding.[110] In May 2017, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing. He was one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill.[107]\nIn November 2017, Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant in a Wilfrid Laurier University first-year communications course, was censured by her professors for showing a segment of The Agenda, which featured Peterson debating Bill C-16 with another professor, during a classroom discussion about pronouns.[111][112][113] The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \"toxic climate\", being compared to a \"speech by Hitler\",[30] and being itself in violation of Bill C-16.[114] The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized.[115][116][117] The events were criticized by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards[118][119][120] and national newspaper columnists[121][122][123][124] as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors.[125] As of September\u00a02018,[update] Wilfrid Laurier had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech.[126]\nPeterson has argued that there is an ongoing \"crisis of masculinity\" and \"backlash against masculinity\" in which the \"masculine spirit is under assault\".[24][127][128][129] He has argued that feminism and policies such as no-fault divorce have had adverse effects on gender relations and have destabilized society.[127] He has argued that the left characterises the existing societal hierarchy as an \"oppressive patriarchy\" but \"don\u2019t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.\"[24] Peterson has said that men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that male violence is reduced in societies wherein monogamy is a social norm.[24][127] He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a negative reaction to a push to \"feminize\" men, saying \"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\"[130] He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview where he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap.[131][132] Peterson disputed the contention that the disparity was solely due to sexual discrimination.[132][133][134]\nPeterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change,[135][136] saying he is \"very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change,\"[137] and that \"[y]ou can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved\".[136][138]\nPeterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989.[29] They have one daughter and one son.[25][29]\nIn a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a Christian; he responded, \"I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes\".[139] When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist\".[10] Writing for The Spectator, Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said that Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.[32]\nStarting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings.[30] The paintings are displayed in his house as a reminder of the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror.[4][38] In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ('Great Seeker').[30][140]\nIn late 2016, Peterson went on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables to control severe depression and an autoimmune disorder, including psoriasis and uveitis.[26][141] In mid 2018 he stopped eating vegetables, and continued eating only beef (see carnivore diet).[142] In 2019, Peterson entered a rehabilitation facility after experiencing symptoms of physical withdrawal when he stopped taking clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug. He had begun taking the drug upon his doctor's recommendation following his wife's cancer diagnosis.[143][144][145]\n</body></html>"

Her music is noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality; its themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia; and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.[1] Born in New York City and raised in Upstate New York, Del Rey returned to New York City in 2005 to begin her music career. Following numerous projects including her debut studio album and the unreleased Sirens, Del Rey's breakthrough came after the viral success of her debut single \"Video Games\" in 2011.[2] She signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major label debut Born to Die (2012) proved an international success and spawned a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 with the Cedric Gervais remix of \"Summertime Sadness\", as well as the internationally successful singles \"Blue Jeans\", \"Born to Die\", and \"National Anthem\".[3] Del Rey released the Grammy-nominated EP, Paradise in 2012. The next year, Del Rey ventured into film as she wrote and starred in the short music film, Tropico, and released \"Young and Beautiful\" as the lead single for the romantic drama film The Great Gatsby (2013). Del Rey subsequently issued her sophomore major label effort, Ultraviolence (2014), to critical success, topping the charts and spawning the single, \"West Coast\". That same year, Del Rey recorded the eponymous theme for the drama film Big Eyes, which garnered her Grammy and Golden Globe nominations. Del Rey released the album Honeymoon in 2015 and Lust for Life in 2017, the latter of which topped the charts in the U.S. and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Her sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell! (2019), received widespread critical acclaim and two Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year.[4] In 2019, Del Rey also released the singles \"Doin' Time\" and \"Don't Call Me Angel\", the latter being a trio with Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus. As of 2020, Del Rey has sold 19.1 million albums and over 13 million singles worldwide[5][6][7][8]. Her YouTube and Vevo pages have combined lifetime views of 3.5 billion.[9] Del Rey was born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985[10] in Manhattan, New York City,[11] to Robert England Grant, Jr., a wealthy Grey Group copywriter, and Patricia Ann \"Pat\" (n\u00e9e Hill), an account executive at Grey Group.[12][13][14] She has one younger sister, Caroline,[15] and one younger brother, Charlie.[16][17] She was raised Roman Catholic.[18] When Grant was one year old, the family moved to the upstate New York town of Lake Placid, which famously hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics. [19] In Lake Placid, her father initially worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;[20] her mother worked as a schoolteacher.[21] In Lake Placid, she attended a Catholic elementary school[17] and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.[17][22] She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year,[21] but, at age 15,[11][21][23] was sent to Kent School by her parents[23] to resolve a budding drinking problem.[24] Her uncle, an admissions officer at the boarding school, secured her financial aid to attend.[20][25][26][27] According to Grant, she had trouble making friends throughout much of her teenage and early adult years.[28][29] She elaborated on being preoccupied with death from a young age, and its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn\u2019t believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble. I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time in my life.[30] After graduating from the Kent School, she was accepted to the State University of New York at Geneseo, but decided not to attend; instead she spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle while working as a waitress.[20] During this time, Grant's uncle taught her how to play guitar, and she \"realized [that she] could probably write a million songs with those six chords.\"[31] Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as \"Sparkle Jump Rope Queen\" and \"Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena\".[31] \"I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously\", she said. \"When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn\u2014I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point\u2014and that was it.\"[11] In the fall of 2004, at age 19, Grant enrolled at Fordham University in The Bronx where she majored in philosophy, with an emphasis on metaphysics.[11] She has said she chose to study the subject because it \"bridged the gap between God and science... I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why.\"[11] In the spring of 2005, while still in college, Del Rey registered a seven-track extended play with the United States Copyright Office; the application title was Rock Me Stable with another title Young Like Me also listed.[32] A second extended play, titled From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer.[33] Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded an acoustic album titled Sirens under the May Jailer project,[33] which later leaked on the internet in mid-2012.[34][35][36][37][38] \u2014Del Rey explaining why she went into the music industry.[29] At her first public performance in 2006, for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, an A&R representative for 5\u00a0Points Records,[39][40] an independent label owned by David Nichtern.[40] In 2007, while a senior at Fordham, she submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks titled No Kung Fu to 5\u00a0Points,[33] who offered her a recording contract for $10,000.[33] She used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey,[11][23] and subsequently began working with producer David Kahne.[40] Executive Nichtern recalled: \"Our plan was to get it all organized and have a record to go and she\u2019d be touring right after she graduated from college. Like a lot of artists, she morphed. When she first came to us, she was playing plunky little acoustic guitar, [had] sort of straight blonde hair, very cute young woman. A little bit dark, but very intelligent. We heard that. But she very quickly kept evolving.\"[40] Del Rey graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Fordham in 2008,[23] after which she released a three-track EP titled Kill Kill in October as Lizzy Grant, featuring production from Kahne.[41] She explained that \"David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop.\"[42] Meanwhile, Del Rey was working doing community outreach work for the homeless and drug addicts;[11] she had become interested in community service work in college, when she had helped paint homes on an Indian reservation in Utah.[17][43] On choosing a stage name for her feature debut album, she said: \"I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba \u2013 Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.\"[44] The name was also inspired by actress Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan (produced and sold in Brazil in the 1980s).[45][46][47] Initially, she had chosen the alternate spelling of Lana Del Ray, the name under which her self-titled debut album was released in January 2010.[40] Her father helped with the marketing of the album,[48] which was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn in April 2010.[40] Kahne, as well as previous label owner Nichtern both stated that Del Rey bought the rights back from the label, 5 Points, as she wanted it out of circulation to \"stifle future opportunities to distribute it\u2014an echo of rumors that the action was part of a calculated strategy.\"[40][49] Del Rey met her managers, Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, three months after Lana Del Ray was released, and they helped her get out of her contract with 5 Points Records, where, in her opinion, \"nothing was happening.\" Shortly after, she moved to London, and moved in with Mawson \"for a few years.\"[17] On September 1, 2010, Del Rey was featured by Mando Diao in their MTV Unplugged concert at Union Film-Studios in Berlin.[50] The same year, she acted in a short film titled Poolside, which she made with several friends.[51] In 2011, Del Rey uploaded self-made music videos for her songs \"Video Games\" and \"Blue Jeans\" to YouTube, featuring vintage footage interspersed with shots of her singing on her webcam.[52] The \"Video Games\" music video became a viral internet sensation,[1] which led to Del Rey being signed by Stranger Records to release the song as her debut single.[53] She told The Observer: \"I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't going to be the single but people have really responded to it.\"[11] The song earned her a Q award for \"Next Big Thing\" in October 2011[54] and an Ivor Novello for \"Best Contemporary Song\" in 2012.[55] The same month, she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album Born to Die.[31][56][57][58] Del Rey performed two songs from the album on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012, and received a negative response from various critics and the general public, who deemed the performance uneven and vocally shaky.[59][60] She had earlier defended her spot on the program, saying: \"I'm a good musician [...] I have been singing for a long time, and I think that [SNL creator] Lorne Michaels knows that [...] it's not a fluke decision.\"[59] Born to Die was released on January 31, 2012, worldwide, and reached number one in 11 countries, though critical reaction was divided.[61][62] The same week, she announced she had bought back the rights to her 2010 debut album, and had plans to re-release it in the summer of 2012 under Interscope Records and Polydor.[63] Contrary to Del Rey's press statement, her previous record label and producer David Kahne have both stated that she bought the rights to the album when she and the label parted company, due to the offer of a new deal, in April 2010.[56] Born to Die sold 3.4\u00a0million copies in 2012, making it the fifth-best-selling album of 2012.[64][65][66] In the United States, Born to Die charted on the Billboard 200 album chart well into 2012, lingering at number 76, after 36\u00a0weeks on the chart.[67] In September 2012, Del Rey unveiled the Jaguar F-Type at the Paris Motor Show.[68] Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar's global brand director, explained their choice, saying Del Rey had \"a unique blend of authenticity and modernity.\"[68] She also recorded the song \"Burning Desire\", which appeared in a promotional short film for the vehicle.[69][70] In late September 2012, a music video for Del Rey's cover version of \"Blue Velvet\" was released as a promotional single for the H&M 2012 autumn campaign, which Del Rey also modeled for in print advertising.[71][72] On September 25, Del Rey released the single \"Ride\" in promotion of her upcoming EP, Paradise.[73] She subsequently premiered the music video for \"Ride\" at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California on October 10, 2012.[74][75] Some critics panned the video for being allegedly pro-prostitution[75][76] and antifeminist, due to Del Rey's portrayal of a prostitute in a biker gang.[77][78] Paradise was released on November 12, 2012 as a standalone release, as well as Born to Die: The Paradise Edition, which combined Del Rey's previous album with the additional eight tracks on Paradise.[73] Paradise marked Del Rey's second top 10 album in the United States, debuting at number 10 on the Billboard 200 with 67,000 copies sold in its first week.[79] It was also later nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.[80] Del Rey received several nominations at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards in November, and won the award for Best Alternative performer.[81] At the Brit Awards in February 2013, she won the award for International Female Solo Artist,[82] followed by two Echo Award wins, in the categories of Best International Newcomer and Best International Pop/Rock Artist.[83] Over the next several months, she released videos of two cover songs: one of Leonard Cohen's \"Chelsea Hotel#2\",[84] followed by a duet with her then-boyfriend, Barrie-James O'Neil, of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra's \"Summer Wine\".[85] In May 2013, Del Rey released an original song, \"Young and Beautiful\" for the soundtrack of the 2013 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby.[86] Following the song's release, it peaked at 22 on the Billboard Hot 100.[87] However, shortly after its release to contemporary hit radio, the label prematurely pulled it and decided to send a different song to that format; on July 2, 2013, a Cedric Gervais remix of Del Rey's \"Summertime Sadness\" was sent there; a sleeper hit, the song proved to be a success, surpassing \"Young and Beautiful\", reaching number 6 and becoming her first American top ten hit.[88] The remix won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical in 2013,[89] while \"Young and Beautiful\" was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[80] In June 2013, Del Rey began filming Tropico, a musical short film paired to tracks from Paradise, directed by Anthony Mandler.[90][91] Del Rey screened the film on December 4, 2013 at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, and presented the screening by stating that she wanted to \"visually close out\" this chapter of her career before releasing her next album.[92] On December 6, an EP, also titled Tropico, was made available for purchase on iTunes, including a digital copy of the short film.[93][94] On January 26, 2014, Del Rey released a cover of \"Once Upon a Dream\" for the 2014 dark fantasy film Maleficent.[95] Following the completion of Paradise, Del Rey began writing and recording her follow-up album, Ultraviolence, featuring production by Dan Auerbach.[96] Ultraviolence was released on June 13, 2014, and debuted at number one in 12 countries, including the United States and United Kingdom. The album sold 880,000 copies in its first week, worldwide.[97] The album was preceded by the singles \"West Coast\", \"Shades of Cool\",[98] \"Ultraviolence\",[99] and \"Brooklyn Baby\".[100] Del Rey described the album as being \"more stripped down but still cinematic and dark,\"[101] while some critics characterized the record as psychedelic[102] and desert rock-influenced, more prominently featuring guitar instrumentation than her previous releases.[103][104] Two new songs by Del Rey, \"Big Eyes\" and \"I Can Fly\", were featured in Tim Burton's 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, which focused on the American artist Margaret Keane, released in November that year.[105] In January 2015, Del Rey hinted that she had been in the process of writing and recording material for her next album.[106] She subsequently confirmed in an interview that her next record would be titled Honeymoon.[107] On January 15, 2015, Del Rey received a BRIT Award nomination for International Female Solo Artist, her second nomination in the category and third overall.[108] Del Rey embarked on The Endless Summer Tour in May 2015, which featured Courtney Love[109] and Grimes as opening acts.[110] After the tour's conclusion in June, she shared \"Honeymoon\", the first and title track from her forthcoming third studio album, on YouTube.[111] In an August 2015 interview, Del Rey revealed that the album would contain fourteen tracks, describing the songs with \"a muddy trap energy and some inspired by late-night Miles Davis drives\".[112] The first single from the album, \"High by the Beach\", was released August 10, followed by \"Terrence Loves You\", released as a promotional single, available instantly with the pre-order of the album.[113] Additionally, Del Rey co-wrote and provided guest vocals on the track \"Prisoner\" from The Weeknd's Beauty Behind the Madness, released on August 28, 2015.[114] Honeymoon was released on September 18, 2015[115] to general acclaim from music critics.[116] Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork deemed it Del Rey's \"most artistic\" work yet, adding: \"It is a dark work, darker even than Ultraviolence. While she's obviously a pop artist, Honeymoon feels as though it belongs to a larger canon of Southern California Gothic albums, and synthesizes ideas she's been vamping on from the beginning into a unified work.\"[117] The album was included in several year-end lists, including Newsweek's Top 20 Albums of the Year,[118] and Billboard's 25 Best Albums of 2015;[119] it was also named the second-best pop album of the year by Rolling Stone.[120] In November 2015, Del Rey executive produced a short film Hi, How Are You Daniel Johnston, documenting the life of singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston.[121] Upon attending the film's premiere with Johnston and director Gabe Sunday, she said: \"The one thing I hoped is that he [Johnston] understood that while he's home alone doing his art still\u00a0\u2013 he says he writes every day\u00a0\u2013 that he knows that he really did make a difference in people's lives. He made a difference in mine.\"[121] For the film, she also covered one of Johnston's songs, called \"Some Things Last a Long Time\", from his album 1990.[122] Also in November 2015, Del Rey received the Trailblazer Award at the Billboard Women in Music ceremony[123] and won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Alternative.[124] In January 2016, Del Rey was nominated for the \"Favorite Female Artist\" award at the People's Choice Awards,[125] and she also received a Brit Award nomination for International Female Solo Artist, her third nomination in the category and fourth overall.[126] The following month, on February 9, Del Rey premiered a music video for the song \"Freak\" from Honeymoon at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles.[127] In March 2016, Del Rey revealed that she had begun working on her fifth studio album, just months after releasing Honeymoon.[128] Del Rey collaborated with The Weeknd for his album Starboy (2016),[129] providing backing vocals on \"Party Monster\" and lead vocals on \"Stargirl Interlude\".[130] \"Party Monster\", which Del Rey also co-wrote, was released as a single[131] and subsequently reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100[132] and was certified double-platinum in the US.[133] Del Rey's fifth studio album, Lust for Life, was released on July 21, 2017.[134] The album was preceded by the singles \"Love\",[135] \"Lust for Life\" with The Weeknd,[136] \"Summer Bummer\" with ASAP Rocky and Playboi Carti, and \"Groupie Love\", also with Rocky.[137] Prior to its release, Del Rey commented: \"I made my first 4 albums for me, but this one is for my fans and about where I hope we are all headed.\"[138] The record further featured collaborations with Stevie Nicks[139] and Sean Ono Lennon,[140] marking the first time she has featured other artists on her own release. The album received generally favorable reviews[141] and became Del Rey's third number-one album in the United Kingdom, and second number-one album in the United States.[142][143] On September 27, 2017, Del Rey announced the LA to the Moon Tour, an official concert tour with Jhen\u00e9 Aiko and Kali Uchis to further promote the album. The tour began in North America during January 2018[144] and concluded in August. Lust for Life was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album for the 60th Grammy Awards, marking Del Rey's second nomination in the category.[145] Throughout 2018, Del Rey appeared as a guest vocalist on several tracks by other musicians, including \"Living with Myself\" by Jonathan Wilson for Rare Birds (2018),[146] \"God Save Our Young Blood\" and \"Blue Madonna\" by B\u00f8rns for Blue Madonna (2018),[147] and \"Woman\" by Cat Power for Wanderer (2018).[148] In November, Del Rey was announced as the face of Gucci's Guilty Fragrances, and subsequently appeared in print and television advertisements with Jared Leto and Courtney Love.[149][150] On August 6, 2019, Del Rey presented filmmaker Guillermo del Toro with his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and subsequently released a cover of \"Season of the Witch\" for his film, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.[151] On the same day, Del Rey released the non-album single \"Looking for America\" which she spontaneously wrote and recorded earlier that week in response to the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton.[152] Norman Fucking Rockwell! was released on August 30, 2019.[153][154][155] Having announced the album in September 2018,[156][157][158] the album was preceded by the singles \"Mariners Apartment Complex\",[159] \"Venice Bitch\",[156] \"Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have \u2013 but I Have It\",[160] and \"Doin' Time\",[161][162] as well as the joint-single \"Fuck It, I Love You\"/ \"The Greatest\".[163] The album received widespread critical acclaim, and, according to review aggregator website Metacritic, is the best-reviewed album of Del Rey's career to date.[164] NME awarded the album a full five out of five stars,[165] In his review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield wrote that \"the long-awaited Norman Fucking Rockwell is even more massive and majestic than everyone hoped it would be. Lana turns her fifth and finest album into a tour of sordid American dreams, going deep cover in all our nation's most twisted fantasies of glamour and danger,\" and ultimately deemed the album a \"pop classic.\"[166] The album was nominated for two Grammy Awards, one for Album of the Year and the other for Song of the Year for its title track.[167][168] In July, Del Rey was also featured on a collaboration with Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, titled \"Don't Call Me Angel\", the lead single of the soundtrack for the 2019 film Charlie's Angels.[169] The song was moderately successful internationally and was later certified Gold in several countries.[170][171] In November, Del Rey appeared in the Amazon Prime Special The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show alongside special guests including Camila Cabello, James Corden, and Troye Sivan.[172][173] In an interview for L'Officiel's first American edition in early 2018, when asked about her interest in making a film Del Rey responded that she had been approached to write a Broadway musical and had recently begun work on it. When asked how long it would be until completion of the work, she replied, \"I may finish in two or three years.\"[174][175] In an interview with The Independent, Del Rey said she did not want to take a break between albums and confirmed that a new record titled White Hot Forever was slated for a 2020 release.[176] She also announced that she will be contributing to the soundtrack of a new adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[citation needed] In 2020, Del Rey will self-publish a book of poetry Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass and release a corresponding spoken word album. Del Rey reported that half of the proceeds from the album will benefit various Native American-centered causes. The record was originally slated for release on January 4, but will be delayed until February due to personal matters.[177] Upon her debut release, Del Rey's music was described as \"Hollywood sadcore\" by some music critics.[178][179] It has been repeatedly noted for its cinematic sound and its references to various aspects of pop culture; both critics and Del Rey herself have noted a persistent theme of 1950s and 1960s Americana.[180][181][182][183][184][185] The strong elements of American nostalgia brought Idolator to classify her firmly as alternative pop.[186] Del Rey elaborated on her connection to the past in an interview with Artistdirect, saying \"I wasn't even born in the '50s but I feel like I was there.\"[187] Associated with several styles, Del Rey's music has been tagged broadly as pop,[188][189][190] rock,[190][191] dream pop[192][193] or baroque pop,[194][195][196][197] and has also been described as indie pop and psychedelic rock[197] (especially on particular releases),[198][199] linked to indie music,[200] and trip hop,[201][202][203] and often touching on styles such as hip hop,[204] lo-fi,[205] and trap.[206] Of Born to Die, indie music journal Drowned in Sound wrote, \"She likes that whole hip hop thing though, has this whole swagger thing going that not many girls like her got\", adding that it sounded like a poppier Bond soundtrack.[207] Del Rey's subsequent releases would introduce variant styles, particularly Ultraviolence, which employed a guitar-based sound akin to psychedelic and desert rock.[208] Kenneth Partridge of Billboard noted this shift in style, writing: \"She sings about drugs, cars, money, and the bad boys she's always falling for, and while there remains a sepia-toned mid-century flavor to many of these songs, [Del Rey] is no longer fronting like a thugged-out Bette Davis.\"[209] Upon the release of Honeymoon, one reviewer characterized Del Rey's body of work as being \"about music as a time warp, with her languorous croons over molasses-like arrangements meant to make clock hands seem to move so slowly that it feels possible, at times, they might go backwards.\"[210] Prior to coming to prominence under the stage name Lana Del Rey, she performed under the names Lizzy Grant, Lana Rey Del Mar,[211] Sparkle Jump Rope Queen,[212] and May Jailer.[213] Under the stage name Lizzy Grant, she referred to her music as \"Hawaiian glam metal\",[214] while the work of her May Jailer project was acoustic.[213][215][216] Del Rey cites a wide array of musical artists as influences, including numerous pop, jazz, and blues performers from the mid-twentieth century, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber,[217] Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Bobby Vinton,[218] The Crystals,[218] and Miles Davis.[112] Torch singers Julie London[219] and Julee Cruise have also served as influences.[218] \"[I really] just like the masters of every genre\", she told BBC radio presenter Jo Whiley in 2012, naming Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley, specifically.[220] Several rock musicians and groups from the late-twentieth century have also inspired Del Rey, such as Bruce Springsteen,[221] singer-songwriter Lou Reed, and rock band The Eagles, as well as folk musicians such as Leonard Cohen[218] and Joan Baez. Del Rey has also cited contemporary artists such as singer-songwriter Cat Power,[221] Hole frontwoman Courtney Love,[222] rapper Eminem, and singer Amy Winehouse, as artists she looked up to.[218] Her favorite films, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and American Beauty have also inspired her musical style.[223] Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting.[224][225] Del Rey has also cited film directors David Lynch and Federico Fellini, and the painters Mark Ryden and Pablo Picasso as influences.[187][226] Del Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which spans three-plus octaves and has been described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy ornaments in her lower gesture with great ease.[227][228][229][230] Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics fell into favor with Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive delivery.[231][232][233] When recording in the studio Del Rey is known for vocal multi-layering, which, as it has been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of backing singers to fill out the original vocal style.[227] Stage fright has also been noted as a major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances.[234] However, journalists noted in 2014 that her live performances had increased exponentially in confidence. Billboard deemed the Coachella debut of \"West Coast\" to be a \"star-making performance\" and lauded the singer's vocal abilities.[235][236] Contemporary music critics have called her voice \"smoky\",[237] \"gravelly\",[214] and reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe.[214] Upon the 2015 release of Honeymoon, her voice was compared by Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood to those of Julee Cruise and Eartha Kitt.[238] Del Rey started the use of her lower vocals on the tracks from Born to Die, claiming that \"people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway\".[239][240][241] \"I sing low now, but my voice used to be a lot higher. Because of the way I look, I needed something to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to\", she said on the topic.[22] With her music often being noted for its cinematic score-like qualities, Del Rey's videos are also often characterized for their usually cinematic quality with a retro flair. Since her career beginnings as an independent artist, Del Rey has recorded clips of herself singing along to her songs on webcams and juxtaposed them alongside vintage home videos and films to serve as \"homemade music videos\", a style which helped gained her early recognition. Following her early success, Del Rey had a series of high budget music videos including the videos for \"Born To Die\" and \"National Anthem\" (both 2012) and \"Young and Beautiful\" (2013), both of which incorporated elements of 90s cult films while paying tribute to aspects of Americana and New York hip-hop cultures. Her following videos for tracks such as \"Summer Wine\", \"Carmen\", and \"Summertime Sadness\" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The Ultraviolence era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the Honeymoon era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as \"Pretty When You Cry\" and \"Honeymoon\" going unreleased due to Del Rey stating they were \"too boring\" with \"nothing happening\" in them. The Lust For Life era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look. For Norman Fucking Rockwell, Del Rey's sister, Chuck Grant, directed three of the videos in Del Rey's \"homemade video\" format, while Rich Lee directed the two follow-ups in a similar vintage but futuristic manner, as he had the videos on Lust for Life Since her debut, Del Rey has repeatedly collaborated with the same people on her visuals. Among the most notably include directors Anthony Mandler, Rich Lee, Anthony Schumer, Jake Nava, and Francesco Carrozzini, as well as photographers Chuck Grant and Neil Krug. She has also used the same love interests in her videos more than once, most notably Bradley Soileau (appeared in three videos) and Mark Mahoney (appeared in two), while her backup dancers Kira Alger and Alexa Kaye have appeared in four and five videos, respectively. Critics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.[242] A September 2017 concert review published in The New York Times noted: \"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\"[242] Another review by Roy Train published in The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 noted \"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\"[243] Prior to the release of her debut major label album Born to Die in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.[244][245][246] One article by Paul Harris published by The Guardian just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.[245] Harris wrote: The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom. It has speeded up the fame cycle. It is worth noting that the huge backlash to Del Rey is happening before her first album has even been released. This reveals a cultural obsession with the \"authenticity\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.[245]Tony Simon, a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\"[33] In Del Rey's own words, she \"[n]ever had a persona. Never needed one. Never will.\"[247] In a 2017 interview, Del Rey stated, \"I didn't edit myself [on Born to Die] when I could have, because a lot of it's just the way it was. I mean, because I've changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it's not that I don't relate but... A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork.\"[248] Del Rey has been labeled a \"sad girl\" through her music and image.[249][250] Having been labeled as antifeminist by multiple sources,[75][77][78] Del Rey stated: \"For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I'm more interested in ... SpaceX and Tesla, what's going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism ... I'm just not really that interested.\"[251] She also said: For me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti-feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture. Because I don't know too much about the history of feminism, and so I'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation. Everything I was writing was so autobiographical, it could really only be a personal analysis.[252]In 2017, Del Rey further clarified her updated view on feminism in an interview with Pitchfork:[253] Because things have shifted culturally. It\u2019s more appropriate now than under the Obama administration, where at least everyone I knew felt safe. It was a good time. We were on the up-and-up... Women started to feel less safe under this administration instantly. What if they take away Planned Parenthood? What if we can\u2019t get birth control? Now, when people ask me those questions, I feel a little differently...[253]In recent years, Del Rey has made several recordings available as offerings to help support causes she believes in. Her 2019 promotional single \"Looking for America\" was released amidst the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Her upcoming album Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass (2020) will see half of its proceeds going to support Native American land conservancy rights foundations and organizations dedicated to protecting the civil rights of those indigenous to North America. In January 2018, Del Rey announced that she was in a lawsuit with British rock band Radiohead over alleged similarities between their song \"Creep\" and her song \"Get Free\".[254] Following her announcement, legal representatives from their label Warner/Chappell denied the lawsuit as well as Del Rey's claims of the band asking for \"100% of the song's royalties\". Del Rey announced that summer while performing at Lollapalooza in Brazil that the lawsuit was \"over.\"[254] Since her debut, Del Rey has been credited as popularizing the sadcore genre for mainstream audiences.[255] Del Rey has been credited as an influence by a number of artists including Lorde,[256] The Weeknd,[257] Billie Eilish,[258] Finneas, Lauren Jauregui,[259][260] Kevin Abstract,[261][262] Au/Ra,[263] Miley Cyrus,[256] Lauren Aquilina, FLETCHER, Grace Mitchell, Colours,[264] Jacquie Lee, \u00c1ine Cahill, Donika Nuhiu, and Maggie Lindemann. Kim Petras and Niykee Heaton have also expressed admiration for Del Rey's style, with Taylor Swift calling Del Rey her favorite lyricist.[265] Billboard credits Born to Die for being one of the main catalysts for pop's mid-2010s shift from brash EDM to a moodier, hip-hop-inflected palette; they also argue that popular music in the 2010s wouldn't be the same without Del Rey.[266] Billboard also stated that Del Rey has influenced both her peers and the next generation of alternative-leaning pop stars, such as Lorde, Halsey, Billie Eilish, Banks, Sky Ferreira, Father John Misty, Sia, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.[266] Similarly, Vice suggests that \"it's hard to imagine an Eilish, a Lorde, or a Halsey\" without Del Rey.[267] The Washington Post listed Del Rey as the only musician on their \"Decade of Influence\" list.[268] Pitchfork named her the next best American songwriter.[269] The Guardian declared Del Rey's own \"pure female haze\" a \"hallmark of the defiant female pop stars to come\".[270] Del Rey has received many awards, including 2 Brit Awards, 2 MTV Europe Music Awards, a Satellite Award and 9 GAFFA Awards. Alongside those accolades, she has also been nominated for 6 Grammy Awards[271] and a Golden Globe Award. Headlining Promotional",

Her music is noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality; its themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia; and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.[1]\nBorn in New York City and raised in Upstate New York, Del Rey returned to New York City in 2005 to begin her music career. Following numerous projects including her debut studio album and the unreleased Sirens, Del Rey's breakthrough came after the viral success of her debut single \"Video Games\" in 2011.[2] She signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major label debut Born to Die (2012) proved an international success and spawned a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 with the Cedric Gervais remix of \"Summertime Sadness\", as well as the internationally successful singles \"Blue Jeans\", \"Born to Die\", and \"National Anthem\".[3] Del Rey released the Grammy-nominated EP, Paradise in 2012. The next year, Del Rey ventured into film as she wrote and starred in the short music film, Tropico, and released \"Young and Beautiful\" as the lead single for the romantic drama film The Great Gatsby (2013).\nDel Rey subsequently issued her sophomore major label effort, Ultraviolence (2014), to critical success, topping the charts and spawning the single, \"West Coast\". That same year, Del Rey recorded the eponymous theme for the drama film Big Eyes, which garnered her Grammy and Golden Globe nominations. Del Rey released the album Honeymoon in 2015 and Lust for Life in 2017, the latter of which topped the charts in the U.S. and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Her sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell! (2019), received widespread critical acclaim and two Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year.[4] In 2019, Del Rey also released the singles \"Doin' Time\" and \"Don't Call Me Angel\", the latter being a trio with Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus.\nAs of 2020, Del Rey has sold 19.1 million albums and over 13 million singles worldwide[5][6][7][8]. Her YouTube and Vevo pages have combined lifetime views of 3.5 billion.[9]\nDel Rey was born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985[10] in Manhattan, New York City,[11] to Robert England Grant, Jr., a wealthy Grey Group copywriter, and Patricia Ann \"Pat\" (n\u00e9e Hill), an account executive at Grey Group.[12][13][14] She has one younger sister, Caroline,[15] and one younger brother, Charlie.[16][17] She was raised Roman Catholic.[18] When Grant was one year old, the family moved to the upstate New York town of Lake Placid, which famously hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics. [19] In Lake Placid, her father initially worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;[20] her mother worked as a schoolteacher.[21] In Lake Placid, she attended a Catholic elementary school[17] and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.[17][22]\n\nShe attended the high school where her mother taught for one year,[21] but, at age 15,[11][21][23] was sent to Kent School by her parents[23] to resolve a budding drinking problem.[24] Her uncle, an admissions officer at the boarding school, secured her financial aid to attend.[20][25][26][27] According to Grant, she had trouble making friends throughout much of her teenage and early adult years.[28][29] She elaborated on being preoccupied with death from a young age, and its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn\u2019t believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble. I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time in my life.[30]\nAfter graduating from the Kent School, she was accepted to the State University of New York at Geneseo, but decided not to attend; instead she spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle while working as a waitress.[20] During this time, Grant's uncle taught her how to play guitar, and she \"realized [that she] could probably write a million songs with those six chords.\"[31] Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as \"Sparkle Jump Rope Queen\" and \"Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena\".[31] \"I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously\", she said. \"When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn\u2014I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point\u2014and that was it.\"[11]\nIn the fall of 2004, at age 19, Grant enrolled at Fordham University in The Bronx where she majored in philosophy, with an emphasis on metaphysics.[11] She has said she chose to study the subject because it \"bridged the gap between God and science... I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why.\"[11] In the spring of 2005, while still in college, Del Rey registered a seven-track extended play with the United States Copyright Office; the application title was Rock Me Stable with another title Young Like Me also listed.[32] A second extended play, titled From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer.[33] Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded an acoustic album titled Sirens under the May Jailer project,[33] which later leaked on the internet in mid-2012.[34][35][36][37][38]\n\u2014Del Rey explaining why she went into the music industry.[29]\nAt her first public performance in 2006, for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, an A&amp;R representative for 5\u00a0Points Records,[39][40] an independent label owned by David Nichtern.[40] In 2007, while a senior at Fordham, she submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks titled No Kung Fu to 5\u00a0Points,[33] who offered her a recording contract for $10,000.[33] She used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey,[11][23] and subsequently began working with producer David Kahne.[40] Executive Nichtern recalled: \"Our plan was to get it all organized and have a record to go and she\u2019d be touring right after she graduated from college. Like a lot of artists, she morphed. When she first came to us, she was playing plunky little acoustic guitar, [had] sort of straight blonde hair, very cute young woman. A little bit dark, but very intelligent. We heard that. But she very quickly kept evolving.\"[40]\nDel Rey graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Fordham in 2008,[23] after which she released a three-track EP titled Kill Kill in October as Lizzy Grant, featuring production from Kahne.[41] She explained that \"David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop.\"[42] Meanwhile, Del Rey was working doing community outreach work for the homeless and drug addicts;[11] she had become interested in community service work in college, when she had helped paint homes on an Indian reservation in Utah.[17][43]\nOn choosing a stage name for her feature debut album, she said: \"I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba \u2013 Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.\"[44] The name was also inspired by actress Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan (produced and sold in Brazil in the 1980s).[45][46][47] Initially, she had chosen the alternate spelling of Lana Del Ray, the name under which her self-titled debut album was released in January 2010.[40] Her father helped with the marketing of the album,[48] which was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn in April 2010.[40] Kahne, as well as previous label owner Nichtern both stated that Del Rey bought the rights back from the label, 5 Points, as she wanted it out of circulation to \"stifle future opportunities to distribute it\u2014an echo of rumors that the action was part of a calculated strategy.\"[40][49]\nDel Rey met her managers, Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, three months after Lana Del Ray was released, and they helped her get out of her contract with 5 Points Records, where, in her opinion, \"nothing was happening.\" Shortly after, she moved to London, and moved in with Mawson \"for a few years.\"[17]  On September 1, 2010, Del Rey was featured by Mando Diao in their MTV Unplugged concert at Union Film-Studios in Berlin.[50] The same year, she acted in a short film titled Poolside, which she made with several friends.[51]\nIn 2011, Del Rey uploaded self-made music videos for her songs \"Video Games\" and \"Blue Jeans\" to YouTube, featuring vintage footage interspersed with shots of her singing on her webcam.[52] The \"Video Games\" music video became a viral internet sensation,[1] which led to Del Rey being signed by Stranger Records to release the song as her debut single.[53] She told The Observer: \"I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't going to be the single but people have really responded to it.\"[11] The song earned her a Q award for \"Next Big Thing\" in October 2011[54] and an Ivor Novello for \"Best Contemporary Song\" in 2012.[55] The same month, she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album Born to Die.[31][56][57][58] Del Rey performed two songs from the album on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012, and received a negative response from various critics and the general public, who deemed the performance uneven and vocally shaky.[59][60] She had earlier defended her spot on the program, saying: \"I'm a good musician [...] I have been singing for a long time, and I think that [SNL creator] Lorne Michaels knows that [...] it's not a fluke decision.\"[59]\nBorn to Die was released on January 31, 2012, worldwide, and reached number one in 11 countries, though critical reaction was divided.[61][62] The same week, she announced she had bought back the rights to her 2010 debut album, and had plans to re-release it in the summer of 2012 under Interscope Records and Polydor.[63] Contrary to Del Rey's press statement, her previous record label and producer David Kahne have both stated that she bought the rights to the album when she and the label parted company, due to the offer of a new deal, in April 2010.[56] Born to Die sold 3.4\u00a0million copies in 2012, making it the fifth-best-selling album of 2012.[64][65][66] In the United States, Born to Die charted on the Billboard 200 album chart well into 2012, lingering at number 76, after 36\u00a0weeks on the chart.[67]\nIn September 2012, Del Rey unveiled the Jaguar F-Type at the Paris Motor Show.[68] Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar's global brand director, explained their choice, saying Del Rey had \"a unique blend of authenticity and modernity.\"[68] She also recorded the song \"Burning Desire\", which appeared in a promotional short film for the vehicle.[69][70] In late September 2012, a music video for Del Rey's cover version of \"Blue Velvet\" was released as a promotional single for the H&amp;M 2012 autumn campaign, which Del Rey also modeled for in print advertising.[71][72] On September 25, Del Rey released the single  \"Ride\" in promotion of her upcoming EP, Paradise.[73] She subsequently premiered the music video for \"Ride\" at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California on October 10, 2012.[74][75] Some critics panned the video for being allegedly pro-prostitution[75][76] and antifeminist, due to Del Rey's portrayal of a prostitute in a biker gang.[77][78]\nParadise was released on November 12, 2012 as a standalone release, as well as Born to Die: The Paradise Edition, which combined Del Rey's previous album with the additional eight tracks on Paradise.[73] Paradise marked Del Rey's second top 10 album in the United States, debuting at number 10 on the Billboard 200 with 67,000 copies sold in its first week.[79] It was also later nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.[80] Del Rey received several nominations at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards in November, and won the award for Best Alternative performer.[81] At the Brit Awards in February 2013, she won the award for International Female Solo Artist,[82] followed by two Echo Award wins, in the categories of Best International Newcomer and Best International Pop/Rock Artist.[83]\nOver the next several months, she released videos of two cover songs: one of Leonard Cohen's \"Chelsea Hotel#2\",[84] followed by a duet with her then-boyfriend, Barrie-James O'Neil, of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra's \"Summer Wine\".[85] In May 2013, Del Rey released an original song, \"Young and Beautiful\" for the soundtrack of the 2013 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby.[86] Following the song's release, it peaked at 22 on the Billboard Hot 100.[87] However, shortly after its release to contemporary hit radio, the label prematurely pulled it and decided to send a different song to that format; on July 2, 2013, a Cedric Gervais remix of Del Rey's \"Summertime Sadness\" was sent there; a sleeper hit, the song proved to be a success, surpassing \"Young and Beautiful\", reaching number 6 and becoming her first American top ten hit.[88] The remix won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical in 2013,[89] while \"Young and Beautiful\" was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[80]\nIn June 2013, Del Rey began filming Tropico, a musical short film paired to tracks from Paradise, directed by Anthony Mandler.[90][91] Del Rey screened the film on December 4, 2013 at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, and presented the screening by stating that she wanted to \"visually close out\" this chapter of her career before releasing her next album.[92] On December 6, an EP, also titled Tropico, was made available for purchase on iTunes, including a digital copy of the short film.[93][94]\nOn January 26, 2014, Del Rey released a cover of \"Once Upon a Dream\" for the 2014 dark fantasy film Maleficent.[95] Following the completion of Paradise, Del Rey began writing and recording her follow-up album, Ultraviolence, featuring production by Dan Auerbach.[96] Ultraviolence was released on June 13, 2014, and debuted at number one in 12 countries, including the United States and United Kingdom. The album sold 880,000 copies in its first week, worldwide.[97] The album was preceded by the singles \"West Coast\", \"Shades of Cool\",[98] \"Ultraviolence\",[99] and \"Brooklyn Baby\".[100] Del Rey described the album as being \"more stripped down but still cinematic and dark,\"[101] while some critics characterized the record as psychedelic[102] and desert rock-influenced, more prominently featuring guitar instrumentation than her previous releases.[103][104]\nTwo new songs by Del Rey, \"Big Eyes\" and \"I Can Fly\", were featured in Tim Burton's 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, which focused on the American artist Margaret Keane, released in November that year.[105] In January 2015, Del Rey hinted that she had been in the process of writing and recording material for her next album.[106] She subsequently confirmed in an interview that her next record would be titled Honeymoon.[107] On January 15, 2015, Del Rey received a BRIT Award nomination for International Female Solo Artist, her second nomination in the category and third overall.[108]\nDel Rey embarked on The Endless Summer Tour in May 2015, which featured Courtney Love[109] and Grimes as opening acts.[110] After the tour's conclusion in June, she shared \"Honeymoon\", the first and title track from her forthcoming third studio album, on YouTube.[111] In an August 2015 interview, Del Rey revealed that the album would contain fourteen tracks, describing the songs with \"a muddy trap energy and some inspired by late-night Miles Davis drives\".[112] The first single from the album, \"High by the Beach\", was released August 10, followed by \"Terrence Loves You\", released as a promotional single, available instantly with the pre-order of the album.[113] Additionally, Del Rey co-wrote and provided guest vocals on the track \"Prisoner\" from The Weeknd's Beauty Behind the Madness, released on August 28, 2015.[114]\nHoneymoon was released on September 18, 2015[115] to general acclaim from music critics.[116] Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork deemed it Del Rey's \"most artistic\" work yet, adding: \"It is a dark work, darker even than Ultraviolence. While she's obviously a pop artist, Honeymoon feels as though it belongs to a larger canon of Southern California Gothic albums, and synthesizes ideas she's been vamping on from the beginning into a unified work.\"[117] The album was included in several year-end lists, including Newsweek's Top 20 Albums of the Year,[118] and Billboard's 25 Best Albums of 2015;[119] it was also named the second-best pop album of the year by Rolling Stone.[120]\nIn November 2015, Del Rey executive produced a short film Hi, How Are You Daniel Johnston, documenting the life of singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston.[121] Upon attending the film's premiere with Johnston and director Gabe Sunday, she said: \"The one thing I hoped is that he [Johnston] understood that while he's home alone doing his art still\u00a0\u2013 he says he writes every day\u00a0\u2013 that he knows that he really did make a difference in people's lives. He made a difference in mine.\"[121] For the film, she also covered one of Johnston's songs, called \"Some Things Last a Long Time\", from his album 1990.[122] Also in November 2015, Del Rey received the Trailblazer Award at the Billboard Women in Music ceremony[123] and won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Alternative.[124]\nIn January 2016, Del Rey was nominated for the \"Favorite Female Artist\" award at the People's Choice Awards,[125] and she also received a Brit Award nomination for International Female Solo Artist, her third nomination in the category and fourth overall.[126] The following month, on February 9, Del Rey premiered a music video for the song \"Freak\" from Honeymoon at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles.[127] In March 2016, Del Rey revealed that she had begun working on her fifth studio album, just months after releasing Honeymoon.[128]\nDel Rey collaborated with The Weeknd for his album Starboy (2016),[129] providing backing vocals on \"Party Monster\" and lead vocals on \"Stargirl Interlude\".[130] \"Party Monster\", which Del Rey also co-wrote, was released as a single[131] and subsequently reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100[132] and was certified double-platinum in the US.[133]\nDel Rey's fifth studio album, Lust for Life, was released on July 21, 2017.[134] The album was preceded by the singles \"Love\",[135] \"Lust for Life\" with The Weeknd,[136] \"Summer Bummer\" with ASAP Rocky and Playboi Carti, and \"Groupie Love\", also with Rocky.[137] Prior to its release, Del Rey commented: \"I made my first 4 albums for me, but this one is for my fans and about where I hope we are all headed.\"[138] The record further featured collaborations with Stevie Nicks[139] and Sean Ono Lennon,[140] marking the first time she has featured other artists on her own release. The album received generally favorable reviews[141] and became Del Rey's third number-one album in the United Kingdom, and second number-one album in the United States.[142][143] On September 27, 2017, Del Rey announced the LA to the Moon Tour, an official concert tour with Jhen\u00e9 Aiko and Kali Uchis to further promote the album. The tour began in North America during January 2018[144] and concluded in August. Lust for Life was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album for the 60th Grammy Awards, marking Del Rey's second nomination in the category.[145]\nThroughout 2018, Del Rey appeared as a guest vocalist on several tracks by other musicians, including \"Living with Myself\" by Jonathan Wilson for Rare Birds (2018),[146] \"God Save Our Young Blood\" and \"Blue Madonna\" by B\u00f8rns for Blue Madonna (2018),[147] and \"Woman\" by Cat Power for Wanderer (2018).[148] In November, Del Rey was announced as the face of Gucci's Guilty Fragrances, and subsequently appeared in print and television advertisements with Jared Leto and Courtney Love.[149][150]\nOn August 6, 2019, Del Rey presented filmmaker Guillermo del Toro with his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and subsequently released a cover of \"Season of the Witch\" for his film, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.[151] On the same day, Del Rey released the non-album single \"Looking for America\" which she spontaneously wrote and recorded earlier that week in response to the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton.[152]\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! was released on August 30, 2019.[153][154][155] Having announced the album in September 2018,[156][157][158] the album was preceded by the singles \"Mariners Apartment Complex\",[159] \"Venice Bitch\",[156] \"Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have \u2013 but I Have It\",[160] and \"Doin' Time\",[161][162] as well as the joint-single \"Fuck It, I Love You\"/ \"The Greatest\".[163] The album received widespread critical acclaim, and, according to review aggregator website Metacritic, is the best-reviewed album of Del Rey's career to date.[164] NME awarded the album a full five out of five stars,[165]  In his review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield wrote that \"the long-awaited Norman Fucking Rockwell is even more massive and majestic than everyone hoped it would be. Lana turns her fifth and finest album into a tour of sordid American dreams, going deep cover in all our nation's most twisted fantasies of glamour and danger,\" and ultimately deemed the album a \"pop classic.\"[166] The album was nominated for two Grammy Awards, one for Album of the Year and the other for Song of the Year for its title track.[167][168]\nIn July, Del Rey was also featured on a collaboration with Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, titled \"Don't Call Me Angel\", the lead single of the soundtrack for the 2019 film Charlie's Angels.[169] The song was moderately successful internationally and was later certified Gold in several countries.[170][171] In November, Del Rey appeared in the Amazon Prime Special The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show alongside special guests including Camila Cabello, James Corden, and Troye Sivan.[172][173]\nIn an interview for L'Officiel's first American edition in early 2018, when asked about her interest in making a film Del Rey responded that she had been approached to write a Broadway musical and had recently begun work on it. When asked how long it would be until completion of the work, she replied, \"I may finish in two or three years.\"[174][175]\nIn an interview with The Independent, Del Rey said she did not want to take a break between albums and confirmed that a new record titled White Hot Forever was slated for a 2020 release.[176] She also announced that she will be contributing to the soundtrack of a new adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[citation needed]\nIn 2020, Del Rey will self-publish a book of poetry Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass and release a corresponding spoken word album. Del Rey reported that half of the proceeds from the album will benefit various Native American-centered causes. The record was originally slated for release on January 4, but will be delayed until February due to personal matters.[177]\nUpon her debut release, Del Rey's music was described as \"Hollywood sadcore\" by some music critics.[178][179] It has been repeatedly noted for its cinematic sound and its references to various aspects of pop culture; both critics and Del Rey herself have noted a persistent theme of 1950s and 1960s Americana.[180][181][182][183][184][185] The strong elements of American nostalgia brought Idolator to classify her firmly as alternative pop.[186] Del Rey elaborated on her connection to the past in an interview with Artistdirect, saying \"I wasn't even born in the '50s but I feel like I was there.\"[187]\nAssociated with several styles, Del Rey's music has been tagged broadly as pop,[188][189][190] rock,[190][191] dream pop[192][193] or baroque pop,[194][195][196][197] and has also been described as indie pop and psychedelic rock[197] (especially on particular releases),[198][199] linked to indie music,[200] and trip hop,[201][202][203] and often touching on styles such as hip hop,[204] lo-fi,[205] and trap.[206] Of Born to Die, indie music journal Drowned in Sound wrote, \"She likes that whole hip hop thing though, has this whole swagger thing going that not many girls like her got\", adding that it sounded like a poppier Bond soundtrack.[207]\nDel Rey's subsequent releases would introduce variant styles, particularly Ultraviolence, which employed a guitar-based sound akin to psychedelic and desert rock.[208] Kenneth Partridge of Billboard noted this shift in style, writing: \"She sings about drugs, cars, money, and the bad boys she's always falling for, and while there remains a sepia-toned mid-century flavor to many of these songs, [Del Rey] is no longer fronting like a thugged-out Bette Davis.\"[209] Upon the release of Honeymoon, one reviewer characterized Del Rey's body of work as being \"about music as a time warp, with her languorous croons over molasses-like arrangements meant to make clock hands seem to move so slowly that it feels possible, at times, they might go backwards.\"[210]\nPrior to coming to prominence under the stage name Lana Del Rey, she performed under the names Lizzy Grant, Lana Rey Del Mar,[211] Sparkle Jump Rope Queen,[212] and May Jailer.[213] Under the stage name Lizzy Grant, she referred to her music as \"Hawaiian glam metal\",[214] while the work of her May Jailer project was acoustic.[213][215][216]\nDel Rey cites a wide array of musical artists as influences, including numerous pop, jazz, and blues performers from the mid-twentieth century, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber,[217] Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Bobby Vinton,[218] The Crystals,[218] and Miles Davis.[112] Torch singers Julie London[219] and Julee Cruise have also served as influences.[218] \"[I really] just like the masters of every genre\", she told BBC radio presenter Jo Whiley in 2012, naming Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley, specifically.[220]\nSeveral rock musicians and groups from the late-twentieth century have also inspired Del Rey, such as Bruce Springsteen,[221] singer-songwriter Lou Reed, and rock band The Eagles, as well as folk musicians such as Leonard Cohen[218] and Joan Baez. Del Rey has also cited contemporary artists such as singer-songwriter Cat Power,[221] Hole frontwoman Courtney Love,[222] rapper Eminem, and singer Amy Winehouse, as artists she looked up to.[218]\nHer favorite films, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and American Beauty have also inspired her musical style.[223] Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting.[224][225] Del Rey has also cited film directors David Lynch and Federico Fellini, and the painters Mark Ryden and Pablo Picasso as influences.[187][226]\nDel Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which spans three-plus octaves and has been described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy ornaments in her lower gesture with great ease.[227][228][229][230] Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics fell into favor with Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive delivery.[231][232][233] When recording in the studio Del Rey is known for vocal multi-layering, which, as it has been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of backing singers to fill out the original vocal style.[227] Stage fright has also been noted as a major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances.[234] However, journalists noted in 2014 that her live performances had increased exponentially in confidence. Billboard deemed the Coachella debut of \"West Coast\" to be a \"star-making performance\" and lauded the singer's vocal abilities.[235][236] Contemporary music critics have called her voice \"smoky\",[237] \"gravelly\",[214] and reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe.[214] Upon the 2015 release of Honeymoon, her voice was compared by Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood to those of Julee Cruise and Eartha Kitt.[238]\nDel Rey started the use of her lower vocals on the tracks from Born to Die, claiming that \"people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway\".[239][240][241]\n\"I sing low now, but my voice used to be a lot higher. Because of the way I look, I needed something to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to\", she said on the topic.[22]\nWith her music often being noted for its cinematic score-like qualities, Del Rey's videos are also often characterized for their usually cinematic quality with a retro flair. Since her career beginnings as an independent artist, Del Rey has recorded clips of herself singing along to her songs on webcams and juxtaposed them alongside vintage home videos and films to serve as \"homemade music videos\", a style which helped gained her early recognition. Following her early success, Del Rey had a series of high budget music videos including the videos for \"Born To Die\" and \"National Anthem\" (both 2012) and \"Young and Beautiful\" (2013), both of which incorporated elements of 90s cult films while paying tribute to aspects of Americana and New York hip-hop cultures. Her following videos for tracks such as \"Summer Wine\", \"Carmen\", and \"Summertime Sadness\" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The Ultraviolence era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the Honeymoon era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as \"Pretty When You Cry\" and \"Honeymoon\" going unreleased due to Del Rey stating they were \"too boring\" with \"nothing happening\" in them. The Lust For Life era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look. For Norman Fucking Rockwell, Del Rey's sister, Chuck Grant, directed three of the videos in Del Rey's \"homemade video\" format, while Rich Lee directed the two follow-ups in a similar vintage but futuristic manner, as he had the videos on Lust for Life\nSince her debut, Del Rey has repeatedly collaborated with the same people on her visuals. Among the most notably include directors Anthony Mandler, Rich Lee, Anthony Schumer, Jake Nava, and Francesco Carrozzini, as well as photographers Chuck Grant and Neil Krug. She has also used the same love interests in her videos more than once, most notably Bradley Soileau (appeared in three videos) and Mark Mahoney (appeared in two), while her backup dancers Kira Alger and Alexa Kaye have appeared in four and five videos, respectively.\nCritics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.[242] A September 2017 concert review published in The New York Times noted: \"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\"[242] Another review by Roy Train published in The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 noted \"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\"[243]\n\nPrior to the release of her debut major label album Born to Die in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.[244][245][246] One article by Paul Harris published by The Guardian just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.[245] Harris wrote: The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom. It has speeded up the fame cycle. It is worth noting that the huge backlash to Del Rey is happening before her first album has even been released. This reveals a cultural obsession with the \"authenticity\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.[245]Tony Simon, a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\"[33] In Del Rey's own words, she \"[n]ever had a persona. Never needed one. Never will.\"[247]\nIn a 2017 interview, Del Rey stated, \"I didn't edit myself [on Born to Die] when I could have, because a lot of it's just the way it was. I mean, because I've changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it's not that I don't relate but... A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork.\"[248] Del Rey has been labeled a \"sad girl\" through her music and image.[249][250]\nHaving been labeled as antifeminist by multiple sources,[75][77][78] Del Rey stated: \"For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I'm more interested in ... SpaceX and Tesla, what's going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism ... I'm just not really that interested.\"[251] She also said:\nFor me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti-feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture. Because I don't know too much about the history of feminism, and so I'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation. Everything I was writing was so autobiographical, it could really only be a personal analysis.[252]In 2017, Del Rey further clarified her updated view on feminism in an interview with Pitchfork:[253]\nBecause things have shifted culturally. It\u2019s more appropriate now than under the Obama administration, where at least everyone I knew felt safe. It was a good time. We were on the up-and-up... Women started to feel less safe under this administration instantly. What if they take away Planned Parenthood? What if we can\u2019t get birth control? Now, when people ask me those questions, I feel a little differently...[253]In recent years, Del Rey has made several recordings available as offerings to help support causes she believes in. Her 2019 promotional single \"Looking for America\" was released amidst the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Her upcoming album Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass (2020) will see half of its proceeds going to support Native American land conservancy rights foundations and organizations dedicated to protecting the civil rights of those indigenous to North America.\nIn January 2018, Del Rey announced that she was in a lawsuit with British rock band Radiohead over alleged similarities between their song \"Creep\" and her song \"Get Free\".[254] Following her announcement, legal representatives from their label Warner/Chappell denied the lawsuit as well as Del Rey's claims of the band asking for \"100% of the song's royalties\". Del Rey announced that summer while performing at Lollapalooza in Brazil that the lawsuit was \"over.\"[254]\nSince her debut, Del Rey has been credited as popularizing the sadcore genre for mainstream audiences.[255] Del Rey has been credited as an influence by a number of artists including Lorde,[256] The Weeknd,[257] Billie Eilish,[258] Finneas, Lauren Jauregui,[259][260] Kevin Abstract,[261][262] Au/Ra,[263] Miley Cyrus,[256] Lauren Aquilina, FLETCHER, Grace Mitchell, Colours,[264] Jacquie Lee, \u00c1ine Cahill, Donika Nuhiu, and Maggie Lindemann. Kim Petras and Niykee Heaton have also expressed admiration for Del Rey's style, with Taylor Swift calling Del Rey her favorite lyricist.[265]\nBillboard credits Born to Die for being one of the main catalysts for pop's mid-2010s shift from brash EDM to a moodier, hip-hop-inflected palette; they also argue that popular music in the 2010s wouldn't be the same without Del Rey.[266] Billboard also stated that Del Rey has influenced both her peers and the next generation of alternative-leaning pop stars, such as Lorde, Halsey, Billie Eilish, Banks, Sky Ferreira, Father John Misty, Sia, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.[266] Similarly, Vice suggests that \"it's hard to imagine an Eilish, a Lorde, or a Halsey\" without Del Rey.[267]\nThe Washington Post listed Del Rey as the only musician on their \"Decade of Influence\" list.[268] Pitchfork named her the next best American songwriter.[269] The Guardian declared Del Rey's own \"pure female haze\" a \"hallmark of the defiant female pop stars to come\".[270]\nDel Rey has received many awards, including 2 Brit Awards, 2 MTV Europe Music Awards, a Satellite Award and 9 GAFFA Awards. Alongside those accolades, she has also been nominated for 6 Grammy Awards[271] and a Golden Globe Award.\nHeadlining\nPromotional\n</body></html>"

One of the highest-paid actresses in India, her accolades include three Filmfare Awards. She features in listings of the nation's most popular personalities, and Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Padukone, the daughter of the badminton player Prakash Padukone, was born in Copenhagen and raised in Bangalore. As a teenager, she played badminton in national level championships but left her career in the sport to become a fashion model. She soon received offers for film roles and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the Kannada film Aishwarya. Padukone then played a dual role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in her first Bollywood release, the romance Om Shanti Om (2007), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Padukone received praise for her starring role in the romance Love Aaj Kal (2009), but this was followed by a brief setback. The romantic comedy Cocktail (2012) marked a turning point in her career, and she gained further success with starring roles in the romantic comedies Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Chennai Express (both 2013), the heist comedy Happy New Year (2014), Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period dramas Bajirao Mastani (2015) and Padmaavat (2018), and the Hollywood action film XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017). She also received critical acclaim for playing a character based on Juliet in Bhansali's tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013) and a headstrong architect in the comedy-drama Piku (2015), winning two Filmfare Awards for Best Actress. She formed her own company Ka Productions in 2018, under which she produced Chhapaak (2020), in which she also starred as an acid attack survivor. Padukone is the chairperson of the Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image and is the founder of the Live Love Laugh Foundation, which creates awareness on mental health in India. Vocal about issues such as feminism and depression, she also participates in stage shows, has written columns for a newspaper, designed her own line of clothing for women, and is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products. Padukone is married to her frequent co-star Ranveer Singh. Padukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen, Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents.[1][2] Her father, Prakash Padukone, is a former professional badminton player and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent.[3] Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer.[4] Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association.[5] The family relocated to Bangalore, India when Padukone was a year old.[6] She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College.[7] She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career.[6][8] Padukone has said that she was socially awkward as a child and did not have many friends.[6] The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, \"I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep.\"[6] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments.[9] While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight.[10] In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, \"I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all.\"[11] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.[11][12] Early in her career, Padukone gained recognition with a television commercial for the soap Liril and modelled for various other brands and products.[13][14] In 2005, she made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Suneet Varma and won the \"Model of the Year\" award at the Kingfisher Fashion Awards.[15][16] Padukone's fame increased when she appeared in a highly popular print campaign for the 2006 Kingfisher Calendar;[17] the designer Wendell Rodricks commented, \"Since Aishwarya Rai, we haven't had a girl as beautiful and fresh.\"[18] Rodricks had spotted her at a Ganjam jewellery class he was teaching and signed her up with the Matrix agency.[19] At the age of 21, Padukone relocated to Mumbai and stayed at her aunt's home.[6] That year, she gained wider recognition by featuring in the music video for Himesh Reshammiya's song \"Naam Hai Tera\".[20] Padukone soon began to receive offers for film roles.[21] Believing herself to be too inexperienced as an actor, she instead enrolled for a course at Anupam Kher's film academy.[22] Following much media speculation, the director Farah Khan, who had noticed her in Reshammiya's music video, made the decision to cast her for a role in Happy New Year.[6][17] Fashion designer Wendell Rodricks also takes credit in helping her get the role. Farah Khan was looking for a model to star in her next film, and got in touch with Malaika Arora. Rodricks, for whom Padukone had been modelling for roughly two years then, recommended her to Arora, a close friend of his, who in turn recommended her to Khan in 2007.[23] Padukone announced in 2006 that she would make her film debut with Aishwarya, a Kannada film directed by Indrajit Lankesh.[17] The romantic comedy was a remake of the Telugu film Manmadhudu, and she was cast in the title role opposite the actor Upendra. The film proved to be a commercial success.[24] RG Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com was appreciative of Padukone's screen presence but added that \"she needs to work on her emotional scenes.\"[25] By the end of 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007).[26] Set against the backdrop of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual roles of a leading actress of the 1970s, and later, an aspiring actress.[27] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language.[28] Her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty.[29] For one of the songs in the film, \"Dhoom Taana,\u201d Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, \"mesmeriz[ed] audiences\" by using hasta mudras (hand gestures).[30] Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of \u20b91.49 billion (US$21\u00a0million).[31] Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama opined that she had \"all it takes to be a top star\", and she was awarded with the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award and received her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination.[32][33] Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of Om Shanti Om proved a breakthrough for her.[34] Padukone next played the role of one of star Ranbir Kapoor's love interests in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008). The film was a financial success,[35] but Namrata Joshi of Outlook wrote that Padukone's performance was disappointing; \"She is mannequin-like and utterly lacks fire and zing.\"[36] Her first release of 2009 came alongside Akshay Kumar in Nikhil Advani's kung fu comedy Chandni Chowk To China, in which she portrayed dual roles of Indian-Chinese twin sisters. Produced by Warner Bros., it had one of the widest international releases given to an Indian film.[37] Padukone learned jujutsu and performed her own stunts.[38][39] Despite the hype, Chandni Chowk To China was a financial failure, failing to recoup its \u20b9800 million (US$11\u00a0million) budget.[40][41] Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of Om Shanti Om proved a breakthrough for Padukone.[42] Following an item number (for a song called \"Love Mera Hit Hit\") in the drama Billu,[43] she appeared alongside Saif Ali Khan in the romantic drama Love Aaj Kal from the writer-director Imtiaz Ali. The film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth and had Padukone play the part of Meera Pandit, a head-strong career woman. With a worldwide gross of \u20b91.2 billion (US$17\u00a0million), Love Aaj Kal proved to be the third highest-grossing film of 2009.[31] Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis said that Padukone \"delivers the best of her four performances so far\".[44] At the 55th Filmfare Awards Padukone received a nomination for Best Actress.[45] Padukone had five film releases in 2010. Her first role was in the psychological thriller Karthik Calling Karthik, where Padukone was cast as the supportive girlfriend of a depressed man (played by Farhan Akhtar). Derek Elley of Variety found the film to be \"thinly plotted\" but considered \"the uncomplicated ingenuousness of Padukone\" to be the film's highlight.[46] Commercially, the film performed poorly.[47] Her most financially profitable film that year was Sajid Khan's \u20b91.15 billion (US$16\u00a0million)-grossing comedy film Housefull in which she featured alongside an ensemble cast headlined by Akshay Kumar.[31] Raja Sen described the film as a \"festival of bad acting\" and attributed Padukone's poor performance to her \"plasticky expressions.\"[48] Pradeep Sarkar's drama Lafangey Parindey (2010) starred Padukone as a blind girl determined to win a skating competition. In preparation, she observed the interactions of blind people and rehearsed scenes while blindfolded.[49] Writing for The Hindu, Sudhish Kamath was particularly impressed by the \"considerable restraint\" with which she played her part.[50] Her next role was opposite Imran Khan in the romantic comedy Break Ke Baad. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand found the film to be \"watchable largely for the performance of its leading lady.\"[51] Padukone's final release of 2010 was Ashutosh Gowarikar's period film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey opposite Abhishek Bachchan. Based on the book Do and Die, the film is a retelling of the 1930 Chittagong armoury raid.[52] Bachchan featured as the revolutionary leader Surya Sen and Padukone played Kalpana Dutta, his confidante.[53] Padukone said that she was unable to research her role as there was very little information on Dutta and relied on Gowarikar's direction.[54] It did not perform well commercially.[55] Padukone began 2011 with an item number in Rohan Sippy's Dum Maaro Dum.[56] She referred to it as \"the wildest song any actress has done;\" the song's sexual content attracted controversy including a court case for indecency.[57][58] Her next film was Prakash Jha's socio-political drama Aarakshan, which dealt with caste-based reservations in India. Trade journalists had high expectations for the film which ultimately flopped at the box office.[59][60] Critical reaction was largely negative, though Pratim D. Gupta mentioned Padukone as the most \"refreshing thing\" about it.[61][62] Her final appearance that year was in Rohit Dhawan's comedy-drama Desi Boyz alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham and Chitrangada Singh, a role that failed to propel her career forward.[63][64] The series of poorly received films led critics to perceive that Padukone had \"[lost] her sparkle.\"[65] Padukone has said that her starring role in the 2012 Homi Adajania-directed romantic comedy Cocktail marked a significant turning point in her career.[66] Raja Sen of Rediff.com opined that she had successfully proved to be a \"stunning girl who can also act.\"[67] Set in London, Cocktail tells the story of a man's relationship with two temperamentally different women\u2014an impulsive party girl (Veronica, played by Padukone) and a submissive girl next door (Meera, played by Diana Penty). During the script narration, the producer Dinesh Vijan offered Padukone the choice of which woman to play; she decided on Veronica to expand her horizons as an actress.[68] Portraying the role was a creative and physical challenge for her, and to achieve the physical requirements of her character she exercised extensively and followed a rigorous diet.[69][70] Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but particularly praised Padukone's performance;[71] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare credited her as the \"soul of the film\" and wrote that she \"excels in every scene, whether as a material girl who enjoys sex, drugs and rock and roll or as the jealousy ridden girl out to destroy herself.\"[72] Cocktail earned Padukone Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare, Screen, and IIFA.[73] The film proved to be a box office success as well.[74] In 2013, Padukone had established herself as a leading actress of Hindi cinema by featuring in four of the top-grossing productions of the year.[75][76] She collaborated with Saif Ali Khan for the fourth time in Abbas-Mustan's Race 2, an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to Race (2008). The film received predominantly negative reviews,[77] but with a total collection of \u20b91.62 billion (US$23\u00a0million), it proved to be a commercial success.[78][79] Ayan Mukerji's romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani was Padukone's next film release. Co-starring opposite Ranbir Kapoor, she was cast as Naina Talwar, a \"shy wallflower,\" which marked a departure from the glamorous characters that she had a reputation for portraying.[80] Raja Sen thought that the film \"lacked a good story\" but added that Padukone \"acts within herself and eschews exaggeration, and the results are impressive\u00a0... This may be her most self-aware performance so far\".[81] The pairing of Padukone with her former boyfriend was anticipated,[82] and the film emerged as a major commercial success.[78][83] Her next appearance was opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Rohit Shetty's action-comedy film Chennai Express, as a Tamil girl on the run from her father (a local don), which required that she adopt a Tamil accent. Critical opinion on her accent was mixed,[84] but her performance received praise;[85] film critic Aseem Chhabra wrote, \"Padukone is delightful in the film\u2014beautiful, smiling, and often a lot more playful and funny than Khan.\"[86] Chennai Express earned over \u20b93.95 billion (US$55\u00a0million) to emerge as one of the highest-grossing Indian films.[87] Padukone next played opposite Ranveer Singh in Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, an adaptation of the Shakespearean tragedy of Romeo and Juliet from director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Her role was Leela, a Gujarati girl based on the character of Juliet.[88] Initially titled Ram-Leela, the film's title was changed after a court case was registered against Bhansali, Padukone, and Singh for \"offending the religious sentiments\" of the Hindu community by showcasing sex and violence under a title that referred to the life of Rama.[89] Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela released among protests across several states in India, but was generally well received by critics.[90][91] Meena Iyer of The Times of India mentioned Padukone as \"breathtaking\", and writing for Deccan Chronicle, Khalid Mohamed concluded that \"it's Deepika Padukone whom the film belongs to. Looking drop dead gorgeous and going at her part with a wallop, she's the prime asset of Ram-Leela.\"[92][93] Her performances in Chennai Express and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela won her several awards,[94] including the Screen Award for Best Actress for both films and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the latter.[95][96] In 2014, Padukone featured opposite Rajinikanth in the Tamil film Kochadaiiyaan, a period drama that was shot using motion capture technology.[97] She was paid \u20b930 million (US$420,000) for two days worth of work in it.[98][99] In Homi Adajania's praised satire Finding Fanny, Padukone played a young widow who takes a road trip with her dysfunctional friends (played by Arjun Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, Dimple Kapadia and Pankaj Kapur) in search of a woman named Fanny.[100] The film was screened at the 19th Busan International Film Festival;[101] critic Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote that Padukone successfully \"takes off the fineries of Bollywood and you can sense the freedom from baggage in her performance\".[102] Later that year, she starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan for the third time in Farah Khan's renewal of Happy New Year. She played a bar dancer who trains a group of underachievers for a dance competition. Sanjukta Sharma of Mint found her role to be of minimal importance that required her only to be \"a pretty thing to be laughed at and pitied\", but the film became one of her most successful, earning over \u20b93.4 billion (US$48\u00a0million) worldwide.[87][103] Following an appearance in Homi Adajania's online video on feminism, entitled My Choice,[104] Padukone took on the role of a headstrong Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in Shoojit Sircar's comedy-drama Piku (2015). She was drawn to the depiction of a realistic father-daughter bond, which she thought was rare in Hindi cinema.[105] Reviews for the film were positive;[106] Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves \"what she is capable of when given something more to do than look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties\".[107] NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she \"holds Piku together with a restrained star turn\".[108] With a worldwide gross of over \u20b91.40 billion (US$20\u00a0million), Piku emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen.[109][110] Later in 2015, Padukone played the part of a businessperson who helps Ranbir Kapoor's character overcome his conflicts in Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Tamasha. Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she \"is so potent in Tamasha, it's almost as if you can hear her heartbeat across the screen\".[111][112] In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in Bajirao Mastani, a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I, while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. To play the warrior-princess Mastani, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding, and the martial art form of kalaripayattu.[113] With a revenue of over \u20b93.5 billion (US$49\u00a0million), Bajirao Mastani proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.[87] Anupama Chopra found Padukone \"riveting\", but Subhash K. Jha thought that she was \"way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough\".[114][115] The film was showcased at the International Film Festival of India;[116] at the 61st Filmfare Awards, Bajirao Mastani was named Best Film and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year.[109][117] The action film XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017), in which Padukone played the lead female role of Serena Unger, opposite Vin Diesel, marked her first project in Hollywood.[118] Critical reception of the film was mixed.[119] Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer termed the film a \"repetitious heap of remarkably tedious CGI-enhanced action scenes\" and thought that Padukone's talent was wasted in it.[120] Conversely, Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter believed that she had successfully \"outclassed\" Diesel to \"practically [steal] the film\".[121] The film earned over US$345 million worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office.[122] Padukone received three nominations at the Teen Choice Awards and followed it with an item number in the romantic drama Raabta.[123][124][125] In 2018, Padukone portrayed Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen who commits jauhar (self-immolation) to protect herself from the Muslim invader Alauddin Khilji, in the period drama Padmaavat; it marked her third collaboration with Bhansali and Singh.[126] She was challenged by the need to convey her character's courage through silence and considered it to be the most emotionally exhausting role of her career.[127] She read history books on the era and researched the various historical depictions of Padmavati.[127] Right-wing Hindu groups speculated that the film portrayed a romantic liaison between Padmavati and Khilji; they protested violently and placed a bounty to behead Padukone and Bhansali.[128] Following a deferment in release, the film was cleared for exhibition after several modifications were made to it.[129][130] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost criticised the film's glorification of jauhar, but credited Padukone for managing to \"eke something out of the stereotype-ridden writing\".[131] With an estimated budget of \u20b92 billion (US$28\u00a0million), Padmaavat is one of the most expensive Hindi films, and with earnings of \u20b95.45 billion (US$76\u00a0million), it is Padukone's highest-grossing release and one of Indian cinema's biggest grossers.[132][133] She received another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.[134] Following the success of Padmaavat, Padukone took some time off work to focus on her home and family.[135] In 2018, she formed her own company, named Ka Productions.[136] Her first production venture came with Chhapaak (2020), a drama by Meghna Gulzar, in which she starred as an acid attack survivor (based on Laxmi Agarwal).[137] She found it taxing to film in extreme heat wearing prosthetic makeup on her face, and considered it to be the most physically challenging role of her career.[138] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express credited her for \"not just putting the focus on the ravaged-skin-with a missing ear-and-nostril, but reflecting a mix of pain, anger, resignation, and finally, arriving at some kind of resolution\".[139] Teo Bugbee of The New York Times added that \"Padukone is by turns inquisitive, watchful and serene but never maudlin\".[140] It did not perform well commercially.[141] Padukone's next production venture will be 83, a sports film about India's victory at the 1983 Cricket World Cup, starring Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev, in which she will also take on the role of Dev's wife, Romi.[142] She has committed to star alongside Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ananya Panday in Shakun Batra's as-yet untitled romantic drama, and to portray Draupadi in a retelling of the Mahabharata from her character's perspective, which she will also be producing.[143][144] Padukone will also produce and star in a remake of the American comedy film The Intern, co-starring Rishi Kapoor.[145] Padukone shares a close bond with her family, and visits them regularly in her hometown of Bangalore.[146] She lives in Prabhadevi, a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and has admitted to missing the presence of her parents there.[6][147][148] A practicing Hindu, Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to temples and other religious shrines.[149] While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Padukone began a romantic relationship with co-star Ranbir Kapoor.[150] She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the nape of her neck.[151] She has said that the relationship had a profound effect on her, transforming her into a more confident and social person.[6] The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years.[152] The couple broke up a year later;[153] she professed in an interview to feeling betrayed for a long time.[6] In a 2010 interview, Padukone accused him of infidelity, and Kapoor later admitted to it.[154][155][156] They reconciled their friendship while working on Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.[157] Padukone subsequently became reticent to discuss her personal life, but in 2017, she fondly spoke of her relationship with her frequent co-star Ranveer Singh, whom she began dating in 2012.[127][158] In November 2018, the couple married in traditional Konkani and Sindhi ceremonies at Lake Como, Italy.[159] In addition to acting, Padukone has written opinion columns and has been involved with women's health and fitness magazines. She has also supported charitable organisations, and has performed for stage shows. In 2009, she was hired by Hindustan Times to write weekly columns for their lifestyle section; through these columns she interacted with her fans and passed details of her personal and professional life.[160][161] That year, she participated in the World 10K Bangalore marathon, which raised \u20b913.1 million (US$180,000) in support of 81\u00a0NGOs.[162][163] In 2010, Padukone adopted the Maharashtrian village of Ambegaon as part of NDTV's Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity.[164] She visited Indian jawans (troops) in Jammu, for an Independence Day special episode of NDTV's reality show Jai Jawaan.[165] Padukone took part in the opening ceremony of the third season of the Indian Premier League at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.[166] Three years later, she performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, and Pitbull for the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League.[167] In 2014, she participated in a concert tour across North America, entitled \"SLAM! The Tour\", in which she performed alongside her co-stars from Happy New Year.[168] Padukone has also been involved with the Olympic Gold Quest team, established by her father and Geet Sethi to support Indian athletes at the Olympic Games, along with sports personalities such as Leander Paes and Viswanathan Anand and several other actors.[169] In 2013, she launched her own line of clothing for women, in association with the retail chain Van Heusen.[170] Two years later, Padukone collaborated with the fashion portal Myntra to launch another line under her brand \"All About You\".[171] In 2019, she was appointed as the chairperson of the Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image.[172] Through her own company, Ka Enterprises, Padukone invested in Drum Foods International, a fast-moving consumer goods company, and Blu Smart, an electric taxi startup.[173][174] Padukone has also been outspoken on issues such as feminism and has said, \"New feminism isn't about being aggressive; it's about reaching the top yet being soft. It's about being you \u2014 feminine, strong and full of will power.\u201d[175] In a 2015 interview, Padukone spoke about her personal experience of overcoming depression, and in October that year she formed a foundation to create awareness on mental health in India, named The Live Love Laugh Foundation.[176][177] The following year, she launched a campaign named More Than Just Sad to assist general physicians in their treatment of patients suffering from depression or anxiety.[178] Also in 2016, the foundation teamed with Facebook and the AASRA organisation to launch multilingual tools and educational resources in Facebook's networking site to support people with suicidal tendencies.[179] Padukone became the brand ambassador for the NGO Indian Psychiatric Society and on her foundation's first anniversary, the two organisations collaborated to launch the video and poster campaign #DobaraPoocho dedicated to victims and survivors of depression.[180][181] The World Economic Forum presented her with the Crystal Award in 2020 for creating awareness on mental health.[182] In 2020, Padukone lent her support to students who were brutalised during the 2020 JNU Attack due to their protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.[183] Members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party criticised her decision and asked people to boycott her film Chhapaak.[184] Many others praised her for standing up against a crackdown on dissent, as mainstream Bollywood actors avoid making political statements fearing backlash and consequences on their film.[185] The journalist Vir Sanghvi, in 2013, described Padukone as \"strong, someone who makes up her own mind, [and] has motivation within herself.\"[186] She is particularly known in the media as a professional, disciplined performer, whose \"work takes precedence over everything else.\"[65] A reviewer for Rediff.com described her personality as \"simple,\" \"grounded,\" and \"accessible,\" and wrote, \"She takes criticism in her stride, acknowledges her limitations and strives to work hard at getting better. She handles praise with equal composure.\"[187] Ayan Mukerji (the director of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani) considers her to be \"a woman who will flirt with you but you will love to take her home to meet your mom as well.\"[65] Padukone has maintained a Twitter account since 2010, and launched an official Facebook page in 2013.[188] She is the most followed Asian woman on Twitter.[189][190] Padukone is considered among the most popular and high-profile celebrities in India.[33][85] Analysing her career, Reuters published that after making a successful debut with Om Shanti Om, she featured in a series of films for which critics labelled her as \"wooden\" and \"mocked her accent.\"[191] The Indian Express added, \"Not too long ago after a few unwise script calls and the public blow up of her high profile relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika was written off.

One of the highest-paid actresses in India, her accolades include three Filmfare Awards. She features in listings of the nation's most popular personalities, and Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018.\nPadukone, the daughter of the badminton player Prakash Padukone, was born in Copenhagen and raised in Bangalore. As a teenager, she played badminton in national level championships but left her career in the sport to become a fashion model. She soon received offers for film roles and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the Kannada film Aishwarya. Padukone then played a dual role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in her first Bollywood release, the romance Om Shanti Om (2007), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Padukone received praise for her starring role in the romance Love Aaj Kal (2009), but this was followed by a brief setback. \nThe romantic comedy Cocktail (2012) marked a turning point in her career, and she gained further success with starring roles in the romantic comedies Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Chennai Express (both 2013), the heist comedy Happy New Year (2014), Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period dramas Bajirao Mastani (2015) and Padmaavat (2018), and the Hollywood action film XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017). She also received critical acclaim for playing a character based on Juliet in Bhansali's tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013) and a headstrong architect in the comedy-drama Piku (2015), winning two Filmfare Awards for Best Actress. She formed her own company Ka Productions in 2018, under which she produced Chhapaak (2020), in which she also starred as an acid attack survivor. \nPadukone is the chairperson of the Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image and is the founder of the Live Love Laugh Foundation, which creates awareness on mental health in India. Vocal about issues such as feminism and depression, she also participates in stage shows, has written columns for a newspaper, designed her own line of clothing for women, and is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products. Padukone is married to her frequent co-star Ranveer Singh.\nPadukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen, Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents.[1][2] Her father, Prakash Padukone, is a former professional badminton player and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent.[3] Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer.[4] Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association.[5] The family relocated to Bangalore, India when Padukone was a year old.[6] She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College.[7] She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career.[6][8]\nPadukone has said that she was socially awkward as a child and did not have many friends.[6] The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, \"I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep.\"[6] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments.[9] While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight.[10] In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, \"I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all.\"[11] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.[11][12]\nEarly in her career, Padukone gained recognition with a television commercial for the soap Liril and modelled for various other brands and products.[13][14] In 2005, she made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Suneet Varma and won the \"Model of the Year\" award at the Kingfisher Fashion Awards.[15][16] Padukone's fame increased when she appeared in a highly popular print campaign for the 2006 Kingfisher Calendar;[17] the designer Wendell Rodricks commented, \"Since Aishwarya Rai, we haven't had a girl as beautiful and fresh.\"[18] Rodricks had spotted her at a Ganjam jewellery class he was teaching and signed her up with the Matrix agency.[19] At the age of 21, Padukone relocated to Mumbai and stayed at her aunt's home.[6] That year, she gained wider recognition by featuring in the music video for Himesh Reshammiya's song \"Naam Hai Tera\".[20]\nPadukone soon began to receive offers for film roles.[21] Believing herself to be too inexperienced as an actor, she instead enrolled for a course at Anupam Kher's film academy.[22] Following much media speculation, the director Farah Khan, who had noticed her in Reshammiya's music video, made the decision to cast her for a role in Happy New Year.[6][17] Fashion designer Wendell Rodricks also takes credit in helping her get the role. Farah Khan was looking for a model to star in her next film, and got in touch with Malaika Arora. Rodricks, for whom Padukone had been modelling for roughly two years then, recommended her to Arora, a close friend of his, who in turn recommended her to Khan in 2007.[23]\nPadukone announced in 2006 that she would make her film debut with Aishwarya, a Kannada film directed by Indrajit Lankesh.[17] The romantic comedy was a remake of the Telugu film Manmadhudu, and she was cast in the title role opposite the actor Upendra. The film proved to be a commercial success.[24] RG Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com was appreciative of Padukone's screen presence but added that \"she needs to work on her emotional scenes.\"[25] By the end of 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007).[26] Set against the backdrop of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual roles of a leading actress of the 1970s, and later, an aspiring actress.[27] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language.[28] Her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty.[29] For one of the songs in the film, \"Dhoom Taana,\u201d Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, \"mesmeriz[ed] audiences\" by using hasta mudras (hand gestures).[30] Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of \u20b91.49 billion (US$21\u00a0million).[31] Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama opined that she had \"all it takes to be a top star\", and she was awarded with the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award and received her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination.[32][33] Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of Om Shanti Om proved a breakthrough for her.[34]\nPadukone next played the role of one of star Ranbir Kapoor's love interests in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008). The film was a financial success,[35] but Namrata Joshi of Outlook wrote that Padukone's performance was disappointing; \"She is mannequin-like and utterly lacks fire and zing.\"[36] Her first release of 2009 came alongside Akshay Kumar in Nikhil Advani's kung fu comedy Chandni Chowk To China, in which she portrayed dual roles of Indian-Chinese twin sisters. Produced by Warner Bros., it had one of the widest international releases given to an Indian film.[37] Padukone learned jujutsu and performed her own stunts.[38][39] Despite the hype, Chandni Chowk To China was a financial failure, failing to recoup its \u20b9800 million (US$11\u00a0million) budget.[40][41] Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of Om Shanti Om proved a breakthrough for Padukone.[42] Following an item number (for a song called \"Love Mera Hit Hit\") in the drama Billu,[43] she appeared alongside Saif Ali Khan in the romantic drama Love Aaj Kal from the writer-director Imtiaz Ali. The film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth and had Padukone play the part of Meera Pandit, a head-strong career woman. With a worldwide gross of \u20b91.2 billion (US$17\u00a0million), Love Aaj Kal proved to be the third highest-grossing film of 2009.[31] Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis said that Padukone \"delivers the best of her four performances so far\".[44] At the 55th Filmfare Awards Padukone received a nomination for Best Actress.[45]\nPadukone had five film releases in 2010. Her first role was in the psychological thriller Karthik Calling Karthik, where Padukone was cast as the supportive girlfriend of a depressed man (played by Farhan Akhtar). Derek Elley of Variety found the film to be \"thinly plotted\" but considered \"the uncomplicated ingenuousness of Padukone\" to be the film's highlight.[46] Commercially, the film performed poorly.[47] Her most financially profitable film that year was Sajid Khan's \u20b91.15 billion (US$16\u00a0million)-grossing comedy film Housefull in which she featured alongside an ensemble cast headlined by Akshay Kumar.[31] Raja Sen described the film as a \"festival of bad acting\" and attributed Padukone's poor performance to her \"plasticky expressions.\"[48]\nPradeep Sarkar's drama Lafangey Parindey (2010) starred Padukone as a blind girl determined to win a skating competition. In preparation, she observed the interactions of blind people and rehearsed scenes while blindfolded.[49] Writing for The Hindu, Sudhish Kamath was particularly impressed by the \"considerable restraint\" with which she played her part.[50] Her next role was opposite Imran Khan in the romantic comedy Break Ke Baad. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand found the film to be \"watchable largely for the performance of its leading lady.\"[51] Padukone's final release of 2010 was Ashutosh Gowarikar's period film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey opposite Abhishek Bachchan. Based on the book Do and Die, the film is a retelling of the 1930 Chittagong armoury raid.[52] Bachchan featured as the revolutionary leader Surya Sen and Padukone played Kalpana Dutta, his confidante.[53] Padukone said that she was unable to research her role as there was very little information on Dutta and relied on Gowarikar's direction.[54] It did not perform well commercially.[55]\nPadukone began 2011 with an item number in Rohan Sippy's Dum Maaro Dum.[56] She referred to it as \"the wildest song any actress has done;\" the song's sexual content attracted controversy including a court case for indecency.[57][58] Her next film was Prakash Jha's socio-political drama Aarakshan, which dealt with caste-based reservations in India. Trade journalists had high expectations for the film which ultimately flopped at the box office.[59][60] Critical reaction was largely negative, though Pratim D. Gupta mentioned Padukone as the most \"refreshing thing\" about it.[61][62] Her final appearance that year was in Rohit Dhawan's comedy-drama Desi Boyz alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham and Chitrangada Singh, a role that failed to propel her career forward.[63][64] The series of poorly received films led critics to perceive that Padukone had \"[lost] her sparkle.\"[65]\nPadukone has said that her starring role in the 2012 Homi Adajania-directed romantic comedy Cocktail marked a significant turning point in her career.[66] Raja Sen of Rediff.com opined that she had successfully proved to be a \"stunning girl who can also act.\"[67] Set in London, Cocktail tells the story of a man's relationship with two temperamentally different women\u2014an impulsive party girl (Veronica, played by Padukone) and a submissive girl next door (Meera, played by Diana Penty). During the script narration, the producer Dinesh Vijan offered Padukone the choice of which woman to play; she decided on Veronica to expand her horizons as an actress.[68] Portraying the role was a creative and physical challenge for her, and to achieve the physical requirements of her character she exercised extensively and followed a rigorous diet.[69][70] Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but particularly praised Padukone's performance;[71] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare credited her as the \"soul of the film\" and wrote that she \"excels in every scene, whether as a material girl who enjoys sex, drugs and rock and roll or as the jealousy ridden girl out to destroy herself.\"[72] Cocktail earned Padukone Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare, Screen, and IIFA.[73] The film proved to be a box office success as well.[74]\nIn 2013, Padukone had established herself as a leading actress of Hindi cinema by featuring in four of the top-grossing productions of the year.[75][76] She collaborated with Saif Ali Khan for the fourth time in Abbas-Mustan's Race 2, an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to Race (2008). The film received predominantly negative reviews,[77] but with a total collection of \u20b91.62 billion (US$23\u00a0million), it proved to be a commercial success.[78][79] Ayan Mukerji's romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani was Padukone's next film release. Co-starring opposite Ranbir Kapoor, she was cast as Naina Talwar, a \"shy wallflower,\" which marked a departure from the glamorous characters that she had a reputation for portraying.[80] Raja Sen thought that the film \"lacked a good story\" but added that Padukone \"acts within herself and eschews exaggeration, and the results are impressive\u00a0... This may be her most self-aware performance so far\".[81] The pairing of Padukone with her former boyfriend was anticipated,[82] and the film emerged as a major commercial success.[78][83] Her next appearance was opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Rohit Shetty's action-comedy film Chennai Express, as a Tamil girl on the run from her father (a local don), which required that she adopt a Tamil accent. Critical opinion on her accent was mixed,[84] but her performance received praise;[85] film critic Aseem Chhabra wrote, \"Padukone is delightful in the film\u2014beautiful, smiling, and often a lot more playful and funny than Khan.\"[86] Chennai Express earned  over \u20b93.95 billion (US$55\u00a0million) to emerge as one of the highest-grossing Indian films.[87]\nPadukone next played opposite Ranveer Singh in Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, an adaptation of the Shakespearean tragedy of Romeo and Juliet from director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Her role was Leela, a Gujarati girl based on the character of Juliet.[88] Initially titled Ram-Leela, the film's title was changed after a court case was registered against Bhansali, Padukone, and Singh for \"offending the religious sentiments\" of the Hindu community by showcasing sex and violence under a title that referred to the life of Rama.[89] Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela released among protests across several states in India, but was generally well received by critics.[90][91] Meena Iyer of The Times of India mentioned Padukone as \"breathtaking\", and writing for Deccan Chronicle, Khalid Mohamed concluded that \"it's Deepika Padukone whom the film belongs to. Looking drop dead gorgeous and going at her part with a wallop, she's the prime asset of Ram-Leela.\"[92][93] Her performances in Chennai Express and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela won her several awards,[94] including the Screen Award for Best Actress for both films and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the latter.[95][96]\nIn 2014, Padukone featured opposite Rajinikanth in the Tamil film Kochadaiiyaan, a period drama that was shot using motion capture technology.[97] She was paid \u20b930 million (US$420,000) for two days worth of work in it.[98][99] In Homi Adajania's praised satire Finding Fanny, Padukone played a young widow who takes a road trip with her dysfunctional friends (played by Arjun Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, Dimple Kapadia and Pankaj Kapur) in search of a woman named Fanny.[100] The film was screened at the 19th Busan International Film Festival;[101] critic Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote that Padukone successfully \"takes off the fineries of Bollywood and you can sense the freedom from baggage in her performance\".[102] Later that year, she starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan for the third time in Farah Khan's renewal of Happy New Year. She played a bar dancer who trains a group of underachievers for a dance competition. Sanjukta Sharma of Mint found her role to be of minimal importance that required her only to be \"a pretty thing to be laughed at and pitied\", but the film became one of her most successful, earning over \u20b93.4 billion (US$48\u00a0million) worldwide.[87][103]\nFollowing an appearance in Homi Adajania's online video on feminism, entitled My Choice,[104] Padukone took on the role of a headstrong Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in Shoojit Sircar's comedy-drama Piku (2015). She was drawn to the depiction of a realistic father-daughter bond, which she thought was rare in Hindi cinema.[105] Reviews for the film were positive;[106] Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves \"what she is capable of when given something more to do than look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties\".[107] NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she \"holds Piku together with a restrained star turn\".[108] With a worldwide gross of over \u20b91.40 billion (US$20\u00a0million), Piku emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen.[109][110]\nLater in 2015, Padukone played the part of a businessperson who helps Ranbir Kapoor's character overcome his conflicts in Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Tamasha. Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she \"is so potent in Tamasha, it's almost as if you can hear her heartbeat across the screen\".[111][112] In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in Bajirao Mastani, a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I, while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. To play the warrior-princess Mastani, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding, and the martial art form of kalaripayattu.[113] With a revenue of over \u20b93.5 billion (US$49\u00a0million), Bajirao Mastani proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.[87] Anupama Chopra found Padukone \"riveting\", but Subhash K. Jha thought that she was \"way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough\".[114][115] The film was showcased at the International Film Festival of India;[116] at the 61st Filmfare Awards, Bajirao Mastani was named Best Film and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year.[109][117]\nThe action film XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017), in which Padukone played the lead female role of Serena Unger, opposite Vin Diesel, marked her first project in Hollywood.[118] Critical reception of the film was mixed.[119] Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer termed the film a \"repetitious heap of remarkably tedious CGI-enhanced action scenes\" and thought that Padukone's talent was wasted in it.[120] Conversely, Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter believed that she had successfully \"outclassed\" Diesel to \"practically [steal] the film\".[121] The film earned over US$345 million worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office.[122] Padukone received three nominations at the Teen Choice Awards and followed it with an item number in the romantic drama Raabta.[123][124][125]\nIn 2018, Padukone portrayed Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen who commits jauhar (self-immolation) to protect herself from the Muslim invader Alauddin Khilji, in the period drama Padmaavat; it marked her third collaboration with Bhansali and Singh.[126] She was challenged by the need to convey her character's courage through silence and considered it to be the most emotionally exhausting role of her career.[127] She read history books on the era and researched the various historical depictions of Padmavati.[127] Right-wing Hindu groups speculated that the film portrayed a romantic liaison between Padmavati and Khilji; they protested violently and placed a bounty to behead Padukone and Bhansali.[128] Following a deferment in release, the film was cleared for exhibition after several modifications were made to it.[129][130] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost criticised the film's glorification of jauhar, but credited Padukone for managing to \"eke something out of the stereotype-ridden writing\".[131] With an estimated budget of \u20b92 billion (US$28\u00a0million), Padmaavat is one of the most expensive Hindi films, and with earnings of \u20b95.45 billion (US$76\u00a0million), it is Padukone's highest-grossing release and one of Indian cinema's biggest grossers.[132][133] She received another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.[134]\nFollowing the success of Padmaavat, Padukone took some time off work to focus on her home and family.[135] In 2018, she formed her own company, named Ka Productions.[136] Her first production venture came with Chhapaak (2020), a drama by Meghna Gulzar, in which she starred as an acid attack survivor (based on Laxmi Agarwal).[137] She found it taxing to film in extreme heat wearing prosthetic makeup on her face, and considered it to be the most physically challenging role of her career.[138] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express credited her for \"not just putting the focus on the ravaged-skin-with a missing ear-and-nostril, but reflecting a mix of pain, anger, resignation, and finally, arriving at some kind of resolution\".[139] Teo Bugbee of The New York Times added that \"Padukone is by turns inquisitive, watchful and serene but never maudlin\".[140] It did not perform well commercially.[141]\nPadukone's next production venture will be 83, a sports film about India's victory at the 1983 Cricket World Cup, starring Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev, in which she will also take on the role of Dev's wife, Romi.[142] She has committed to star alongside Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ananya Panday in Shakun Batra's as-yet untitled romantic drama, and to portray Draupadi in a retelling of the Mahabharata from her character's perspective, which she will also be producing.[143][144] Padukone will also produce and star in a remake of the American comedy film The Intern, co-starring Rishi Kapoor.[145]\nPadukone shares a close bond with her family, and visits them regularly in her hometown of Bangalore.[146] She lives in Prabhadevi, a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and has admitted to missing the presence of her parents there.[6][147][148] A practicing Hindu, Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to temples and other religious shrines.[149]\nWhile filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Padukone began a romantic relationship with co-star Ranbir Kapoor.[150] She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the nape of her neck.[151] She has said that the relationship had a profound effect on her, transforming her into a more confident and social person.[6] The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years.[152] The couple broke up a year later;[153] she professed in an interview to feeling betrayed for a long time.[6] In a 2010 interview, Padukone accused him of infidelity, and Kapoor later admitted to it.[154][155][156] They reconciled their friendship while working on Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.[157]\nPadukone subsequently became reticent to discuss her personal life, but in 2017, she fondly spoke of her relationship with her frequent co-star Ranveer Singh, whom she began dating in 2012.[127][158] In November 2018, the couple married in traditional Konkani and Sindhi ceremonies at Lake Como, Italy.[159]\nIn addition to acting, Padukone has written opinion columns and has been involved with women's health and fitness magazines. She has also supported charitable organisations, and has performed for stage shows. In 2009, she was hired by Hindustan Times to write weekly columns for their lifestyle section; through these columns she interacted with her fans and passed details of her personal and professional life.[160][161] That year, she participated in the World 10K Bangalore marathon, which raised \u20b913.1 million (US$180,000) in support of 81\u00a0NGOs.[162][163] In 2010, Padukone adopted the Maharashtrian village of Ambegaon as part of NDTV's Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity.[164] She visited Indian jawans (troops) in Jammu, for an Independence Day special episode of NDTV's reality show Jai Jawaan.[165]\nPadukone took part in the opening ceremony of the third season of the Indian Premier League at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.[166] Three years later, she performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, and Pitbull for the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League.[167] In 2014, she participated in a concert tour across North America, entitled \"SLAM! The Tour\", in which she performed alongside her co-stars from Happy New Year.[168] Padukone has also been involved with the Olympic Gold Quest team, established by her father and Geet Sethi to support Indian athletes at the Olympic Games, along with sports personalities such as Leander Paes and Viswanathan Anand and several other actors.[169] In 2013, she launched her own line of clothing for women, in association with the retail chain Van Heusen.[170] Two years later, Padukone collaborated with the fashion portal Myntra to launch another line under her brand \"All About You\".[171] In 2019, she was appointed as the chairperson of the Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image.[172] Through her own company, Ka Enterprises, Padukone invested in Drum Foods International, a fast-moving consumer goods company, and Blu Smart, an electric taxi startup.[173][174]\nPadukone has also been outspoken on issues such as feminism and has said, \"New feminism isn't about being aggressive; it's about reaching the top yet being soft. It's about being you \u2014 feminine, strong and full of will power.\u201d[175] In a 2015 interview, Padukone spoke about her personal experience of overcoming depression, and in October that year she formed a foundation to create awareness on mental health in India, named The Live Love Laugh Foundation.[176][177] The following year, she launched a campaign named More Than Just Sad to assist general physicians in their treatment of patients suffering from depression or anxiety.[178] Also in 2016, the foundation teamed with Facebook and the AASRA organisation to launch multilingual tools and educational resources in Facebook's networking site to support people with suicidal tendencies.[179] Padukone became the brand ambassador for the NGO Indian Psychiatric Society and on her foundation's first anniversary, the two organisations collaborated to launch the video and poster campaign #DobaraPoocho dedicated to victims and survivors of depression.[180][181] The World Economic Forum presented her with the Crystal Award in 2020 for creating awareness on mental health.[182]\nIn 2020, Padukone lent her support to students who were brutalised during the 2020 JNU Attack due to their protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.[183] Members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party criticised her decision and asked people to boycott her film Chhapaak.[184] Many others praised her for standing up against a crackdown on dissent, as mainstream Bollywood actors avoid making political statements fearing backlash and consequences on their film.[185]\nThe journalist Vir Sanghvi, in 2013, described Padukone as \"strong, someone who makes up her own mind, [and] has motivation within herself.\"[186] She is particularly known in the media as a professional, disciplined performer, whose \"work takes precedence over everything else.\"[65] A reviewer for Rediff.com described her personality as \"simple,\" \"grounded,\" and \"accessible,\" and wrote, \"She takes criticism in her stride, acknowledges her limitations and strives to work hard at getting better.

After a series of supporting film and television roles in the late 1990s, she landed her breakthrough role as Bridget Hennessy on the ABC sitcom 8 Simple Rules, on which she starred from 2002 to 2005. Thereafter, Cuoco appeared as Billie Jenkins on the final season of the television series Charmed (2005\u20132006). She has also starred as Penny on the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007\u20132019), for which she has received Satellite, Critics' Choice, and People's Choice awards. Cuoco's film work includes roles in To Be Fat like Me (2007), Hop (2011) and Authors Anonymous (2014). She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014.[2] In October 2017, Cuoco founded Yes, Norman Productions. Cuoco was born in Camarillo, California, the elder daughter of Layne Ann (Wingate), a homemaker, and Gary Carmine Cuoco, a realtor.[3] Her father is of Italian descent while her mother is of English and German ancestry.[4] Her sister, Briana, competed on the fifth season of The Voice. As a child, Cuoco was a regionally ranked amateur tennis player,[5] a sport she took up when she was 3 years old. She stopped playing at the age of 16.[6] Cuoco made her first feature film appearance as the young Karin Carter in the 1995 action thriller Virtuosity.[7] From 2000 to 2001, Cuoco appeared on the CBS sitcom Ladies Man and in 2000 she portrayed former The Brady Bunch star Maureen McCormick in the TV movie Growing Up Brady as well as starring in the Disney Channel original film Alley Cats Strike. In September 2002, Cuoco began a starring role as Bridget Hennessy on the ABC sitcom 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter (afterwards 8 Simple Rules). Bridget was the oldest child, despite Cuoco being six years younger than Amy Davidson, who played her younger sister. Because of low ratings, ABC canceled the series on May 17, 2005.[citation needed] In addition to the final season of 8 Simple Rules, Cuoco had starring roles on the NBC miniseries 10.5, the ABC Family original movie Crimes of Fashion, the independent film Debating Robert Lee,[8] and in the film The Hollow at the same time.

Cuoco voiced the character of Kirstee Smith in Bratz from 2004 to 2005. In the eighth season of the TV show Charmed, Cuoco appeared as Billie Jenkins, a powerful young witch with the powers of telekinesis and projection. Executive producer Brad Kern stated that Cuoco's character was initially brought in as a possible spin-off.[citation needed] In September 2007, Cuoco began starring in the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, playing Penny, a Cheesecake Factory employee and aspiring actress who lives across the hall from physicists Dr. Leonard Hofstadter and Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Prior to the 2010\u20132011 season, she earned $60,000 an episode for the series, the same as her co-stars. In 2010, the cast negotiated a raise for each actor to make $200,000 per episode.[9] On September 13, 2010, she broke her leg in a horse-riding accident and missed two episodes of the series.[10] As of August 2014, Cuoco and her co-stars from The Big Bang Theory Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons, each earned an estimated $1 million per episode.[11] In late October 2012, Cuoco enlisted the help of her sister Briana to organize a flash mob on the set of the show, in which she and the cast and crew surprised the studio audience by suddenly lip syncing and dancing to Carly Rae Jepsen's song \"Call Me Maybe\". A video of the event was posted on YouTube and became a viral success.[12][13] A clip from the performance was also played during Cuoco's January 8, 2013 appearance on the late night talk show Conan.[14] Cuoco starred in the Lifetime film To Be Fat like Me, which premiered on January 8, 2007.[15] She played a minor role in the Prison Break episodes \"The Message\" and \"Chicago\", as well as starring in the comedy horror spoof Killer Movie in 2008.

She later told CBS Watch in September 2010 that they have remained on good terms since ending their relationship.[23] She became engaged to addiction specialist Josh Resnik in October 2011, but they ended their engagement by March 2012.[24] Cuoco became engaged to professional tennis player Ryan Sweeting in September 2013, after three months of dating. They married on December 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California.[25] On September 25, 2015, it was announced that she and Sweeting had decided to divorce.[26] The divorce was finalized on May 9, 2016.[27] Cuoco began dating equestrian Karl Cook, son of billionaire Scott Cook, in late 2016.[28][29] They became engaged on November 30, 2017, Cuoco's 32nd birthday,[30] and were married on June 30, 2018.[31] Cuoco received significant media attention surrounding a remark she made in an interview with Redbook magazine while married to Ryan Sweeting. When asked if she considered herself a feminist, Cuoco responded: \"Is it bad if I say no? I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that's because I've never really faced inequality... I cook for Ryan five nights a week: it makes me feel like a housewife. I love that. I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men.\"[32][33] In later interviews, Cuoco apologized for and retracted these statements, telling Cosmopolitan magazine, \"Of course I'm a fucking feminist. Look at me. I bleed feminism: I get equal pay to my male costars on a big show, I have my own home, I'm as independent as you could possibly be. Maybe I didn't understand the question, but for me that's feminism. I'm killing the game, man.\"[34][35] In October 2017, Cuoco founded Yes, Norman Productions, a film and television production company which entered an exclusive multi-year first-look production deal with Warner Bros. Television. The company is named after Cuoco's dog, Norman. Also in October 2017, The company optioned the rights to The Flight Attendant, a book written by author Chris Bohjalian, which will be developed into a limited series, with Cuoco to star and executive produce.[36] In October 2018, it was announced that Cuoco would executive produce and voice Harley Quinn in the DC Universe adult animation, Harley Quinn.[22] In July 2019, Yes, Norman entered a two-year first look production deal with Warner Bros. Television, and announced that The Flight Attendant had been pickup by WarnerMedia's upcoming streaming platform, HBO Max.[37][38] In August 2019, it was announced that Cuoco would executive produce the upcoming CBS comedy, Pretty, which is written and also executive produced by Lindsey Kraft and Santina Muha.[39]",

After a series of supporting film and television roles in the late 1990s, she landed her breakthrough role as Bridget Hennessy on the ABC sitcom 8 Simple Rules, on which she starred from 2002 to 2005. Thereafter, Cuoco appeared as Billie Jenkins on the final season of the television series Charmed (2005\u20132006). She has also starred as Penny on the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007\u20132019), for which she has received Satellite, Critics' Choice, and People's Choice awards. Cuoco's film work includes roles in To Be Fat like Me (2007), Hop (2011) and Authors Anonymous (2014). She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014.[2] In October 2017, Cuoco founded Yes, Norman Productions.\nCuoco was born in Camarillo, California, the elder daughter of Layne Ann (Wingate), a homemaker, and Gary Carmine Cuoco, a realtor.[3] Her father is of Italian descent while her mother is of English and German ancestry.[4] Her sister, Briana, competed on the fifth season of The Voice. As a child, Cuoco was a regionally ranked amateur tennis player,[5] a sport she took up when she was 3 years old. She stopped playing at the age of 16.[6]\nCuoco made her first feature film appearance as the young Karin Carter in the 1995 action thriller Virtuosity.[7] From 2000 to 2001, Cuoco appeared on the CBS sitcom Ladies Man and in 2000 she portrayed former The Brady Bunch star Maureen McCormick in the TV movie Growing Up Brady as well as starring in the Disney Channel original film Alley Cats Strike. In September 2002, Cuoco began a starring role as Bridget Hennessy on the ABC sitcom 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter (afterwards 8 Simple Rules). Bridget was the oldest child, despite Cuoco being six years younger than Amy Davidson, who played her younger sister. Because of low ratings, ABC canceled the series on May 17, 2005.[citation needed]\nIn addition to the final season of 8 Simple Rules, Cuoco had starring roles on the NBC miniseries 10.5, the ABC Family original movie Crimes of Fashion, the independent film Debating Robert Lee,[8] and in the film The Hollow at the same time. She also voiced the character of Brandy Harrington, a 14-year-old anthropomorphic mixed-breed dog, on the Disney Channel animated series Brandy and Mr. Whiskers. Cuoco voiced the character of Kirstee Smith in Bratz from 2004 to 2005. In the eighth season of the TV show Charmed, Cuoco appeared as Billie Jenkins, a powerful young witch with the powers of telekinesis and projection. Executive producer Brad Kern stated that Cuoco's character was initially brought in as a possible spin-off.[citation needed]\nIn September 2007, Cuoco began starring in the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, playing Penny, a Cheesecake Factory employee and aspiring actress who lives across the hall from physicists Dr. Leonard Hofstadter and Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Prior to the 2010\u20132011 season, she earned $60,000 an episode for the series, the same as her co-stars. In 2010, the cast negotiated a raise for each actor to make $200,000 per episode.[9] On September 13, 2010, she broke her leg in a horse-riding accident and missed two episodes of the series.[10] As of August 2014, Cuoco and her co-stars from The Big Bang Theory Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons, each earned an estimated $1 million per episode.[11]\nIn late October 2012, Cuoco enlisted the help of her sister Briana to organize a flash mob on the set of the show, in which she and the cast and crew surprised the studio audience by suddenly lip syncing and dancing to Carly Rae Jepsen's song \"Call Me Maybe\". A video of the event was posted on YouTube and became a viral success.[12][13] A clip from the performance was also played during Cuoco's January 8, 2013 appearance on the late night talk show Conan.[14]\nCuoco starred in the Lifetime film To Be Fat like Me, which premiered on January 8, 2007.[15] She played a minor role in the Prison Break episodes \"The Message\" and \"Chicago\", as well as starring in the comedy horror spoof Killer Movie in 2008. She also appeared in the 2010 film The Penthouse. In 2011, Cuoco appeared in Allure magazine's annual \"Naked Truth\" feature.[16] That same year, she appeared in the films Hop and The Last Ride.[17] She was also chosen to host the Teen Choice Awards in 2011,[18] as well as the People's Choice Awards in 2012 and 2013.[19][20] Cuoco is a regular on Priceline.com commercials as the daughter of William Shatner's character.[21]\nIn October 2018, it was announced that Cuoco would voice Harley Quinn and executive produce the DC Universe adult animation, Harley Quinn.[22]\nWhile working on The Big Bang Theory, Cuoco privately dated co-star Johnny Galecki for roughly two years, until December 2009, while their characters on the show were also dating. She later told CBS Watch in September 2010 that they have remained on good terms since ending their relationship.[23] She became engaged to addiction specialist Josh Resnik in October 2011, but they ended their engagement by March 2012.[24]\nCuoco became engaged to professional tennis player Ryan Sweeting in September 2013, after three months of dating. They married on December 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California.[25] On September 25, 2015, it was announced that she and Sweeting had decided to divorce.[26] The divorce was finalized on May 9, 2016.[27]\nCuoco began dating equestrian Karl Cook, son of billionaire Scott Cook, in late 2016.[28][29] They became engaged on November 30, 2017, Cuoco's 32nd birthday,[30] and were married on June 30, 2018.[31]\nCuoco received significant media attention surrounding a remark she made in an interview with Redbook magazine while married to Ryan Sweeting. When asked if she considered herself a feminist, Cuoco responded: \"Is it bad if I say no? I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that's because I've never really faced inequality... I cook for Ryan five nights a week: it makes me feel like a housewife. I love that. I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men.\"[32][33]\nIn later interviews, Cuoco apologized for and retracted these statements, telling Cosmopolitan magazine, \"Of course I'm a fucking feminist. Look at me. I bleed feminism: I get equal pay to my male costars on a big show, I have my own home, I'm as independent as you could possibly be. Maybe I didn't understand the question, but for me that's feminism. I'm killing the game, man.\"[34][35]\nIn October 2017, Cuoco founded Yes, Norman Productions, a film and television production company which entered an exclusive multi-year first-look production deal with Warner Bros. Television. The company is named after Cuoco's dog, Norman. Also in October 2017, The company optioned the rights to The Flight Attendant, a book written by author Chris Bohjalian, which will be developed into a limited series, with Cuoco to star and executive produce.[36]\nIn October 2018, it was announced that Cuoco would executive produce and voice Harley Quinn in the DC Universe adult animation, Harley Quinn.[22] In July 2019, Yes, Norman entered a two-year first look production deal with Warner Bros. Television, and announced that The Flight Attendant had been pickup by WarnerMedia's upcoming streaming platform, HBO Max.[37][38] In August 2019, it was announced that Cuoco would executive produce the upcoming CBS comedy, Pretty, which is written and also executive produced by Lindsey Kraft and Santina Muha.[39]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nEmma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990)[3] is an English actress, model and activist. Born in Paris and brought up in Oxfordshire, Watson attended the Dragon School and trained as an actress at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. As a child, she rose to prominence with her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, having acted only in school plays previously. Watson also appeared in the 2007 television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes and lent her voice to The Tale of Despereaux (2008). After the last Harry Potter film, she took on starring and supporting roles in My Week with Marilyn (2011), The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) and The Bling Ring (2013), made an appearance as an exaggerated version of herself in This Is the End (2013), and portrayed the titular character's adopted daughter in Noah (2014). She went on to star as Belle in the musical romantic fantasy Beauty and the Beast (2017) and Meg March in the coming-of-age film Little Women (2019). Her other film roles include Regression (2015), Colonia (2015), and The Circle (2017). From 2011 to 2014, Watson split her time between working on films and continuing her education, studying at Brown University and Worcester College, Oxford, and graduating from Brown with a bachelor's degree in English literature in May 2014. Her modelling work has included campaigns for Burberry and Lanc\u00f4me. She also lent her name to a line of clothing for People Tree. She was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2014, winning British Artist of the Year. That same year, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador and helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which encourages all genders to work towards gender equality. Watson was born in Paris, France, the daughter of English lawyers Jacqueline Luesby and Chris Watson.[3][4][5] Watson lived in Maisons-Laffitte near Paris until she was five. Her parents divorced when she was young, and Watson moved to England to live with her mother in Oxfordshire while spending weekends at her father's house in London.[3][6] Watson has said she speaks some French, though \"not as well\" as she used to.[7] After moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, she attended the Dragon School, remaining there until 2003.[3] From age six, she wanted to become an actress,[8] and trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing, and acting.[9] By age 10, Watson had performed in Stagecoach productions and school plays including Arthur: The Young Years and The Happy Prince,[10] but she had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series. After the Dragon School, Watson moved on to Headington School, Oxford.[3] While on film sets, she and her peers were tutored for up to five hours a day.[11] In June 2006, she took GCSE school examinations in 10 subjects, achieving eight A* and two A grades. In May 2007, she took AS levels in English, Geography, Art, and History of Art. The next year, she dropped History of Art to pursue the three A levels, receiving an A grade in each subject.[3][12][13] Watson took a gap year after leaving high school,[14] to film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows beginning in February 2009,[15] but said she intended to continue her studies[16] and later confirmed that she had chosen Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.[17] In March 2011, after 18 months at the university, Watson announced that she was deferring her course for \"a semester or two\",[18] though she attended Worcester College, Oxford during the 2011\u201312 academic year as part of the Visiting Student Programme.[19][20] Watson told Ellen DeGeneres just before graduation that it took five years to finish instead of four because, owing to her acting work, she \"ended up taking two full semesters off\".[21] On 25 May 2014, she graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[22] In 2013, she became certified to teach yoga and meditation. As part of this certification, she attended a week-long meditation course at a Canadian facility, in which residents are not allowed to speak, in order \"to figure out how to be at home with myself\".[23][24] She told Elle Australia that an uncertain future meant finding \"a way to always feel safe and at home within myself. Because I can never rely on a physical place.\"[25] In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling's best-selling novel. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint that they had been cast for the roles of the school friends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test.[8] The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2001 was Watson's debut screen performance. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001.[26][27] Critics praised the performances of the three leads, often singling out Watson for particular acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance \"admirable\",[28] and IGN said she \"stole the show\".[29] Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in Philosopher's Stone, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress.[30] A year later, Watson again starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers praised the lead actors' performances. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her peers had matured between films,[31] while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for \"under-employing\" Watson's hugely popular character.[32] Watson received an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo for her performance.[33] In 2004, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. Watson was appreciative of the more assertive role Hermione played, calling her character \"charismatic\" and \"a fantastic role to play\".[34] Although critics panned Radcliffe's performance, labelling him \"wooden\", they praised Watson; The New York Times lauded her performance, saying: \"Luckily Mr. Radcliffe's blandness is offset by Ms. Watson's spiky impatience. Harry may show off his expanding wizardly skills ... but Hermione ... earns the loudest applause with a decidedly unmagical punch to Draco Malfoy's deserving nose.\"[35] Although Prisoner of Azkaban proved to be the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film of the entire series, Watson's personal performance won her two Otto Awards and the Child Performance of the Year award from Total Film.[36][37] With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), both Watson and the Harry Potter film series reached new milestones. The film set records for a Harry Potter opening weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK. Critics praised the increasing maturity of Watson and her teenage co-stars; The New York Times called her performance \"touchingly earnest\".[38] For Watson, much of the humour of the film sprang from the tension among the three lead characters as they matured. She said, \"I loved all the arguing. ... I think it's much more realistic that they would argue and that there would be problems.\"[39] Nominated for three awards for Goblet of Fire, Watson won a bronze Otto Award.[40][41] Later that year, Watson became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Teen Vogue,[42] an appearance she reprised in August 2009.[43] In 2006, Watson played Hermione in The Queen's Handbag, a special mini-episode of Harry Potter in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday.[44] The fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released in 2007. A huge financial success, the film set a record worldwide opening-weekend gross of $332.7\u00a0million.[45] Watson won the inaugural National Movie Award for Best Female Performance.[46] As the fame of the actress and the series continued, Watson and fellow Harry Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint left imprints of their hands, feet and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on 9 July 2007.[47] By July 2007, Watson's work in the Harry Potter series was said to have earned her more than \u00a310\u00a0million, and she acknowledged she would never have to work for money again.[48] In March 2009, she was ranked 6th on the Forbes list of \"Most Valuable Young Stars\",[49] and in February 2010, she was named as Hollywood's highest paid female star, having earned an estimated \u00a319\u00a0million in 2009.[50] Despite the success of Order of the Phoenix, the future of the Harry Potter franchise became surrounded in doubt, as all three lead actors were hesitant to sign on to continue their roles for the final two episodes.[51] Radcliffe eventually signed for the final films on 2 March 2007,[51] but Watson was considerably more hesitant.[52] She explained that the decision was significant, as the films represented a further four-year commitment to the role, but eventually conceded that she \"could never let [the role of] Hermione go\",[53] signing for the role on 23 March 2007.[54] Watson's first non-Potter role was the 2007 BBC film Ballet Shoes, an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Noel Streatfeild.[55][56] The film's director, Sandra Goldbacher, commented that Watson was \"perfect\" for the starring role of aspiring actress Pauline Fossil: \"She has a piercing, delicate aura that makes you want to gaze and gaze at her.\"[57] Ballet Shoes was broadcast in the UK on Boxing Day 2007 to an audience of 5.7\u00a0million viewers, to mixed reviews.[58][59][60] Watson also lent her voice to the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale of Despereaux, a children's comedy starring Matthew Broderick, with Harry Potter co-star Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) also starring in the film.[61] The Tale of Despereaux was released in December 2008 and grossed $87\u00a0million worldwide.[62] Principal photography for the sixth Harry Potter film began in late 2007, with Watson's part being filmed from 18 December to 17 May 2008.[63][64] Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered on 15 July 2009,[65] having been delayed from November 2008.[66] With the lead actors now in their late teens, critics were increasingly willing to review them on the same level as the rest of the film's all-star cast, which the Los Angeles Times described as \"a comprehensive guide to contemporary UK acting\".[67] The Washington Post felt Watson to have given \"[her] most charming performance to date\",[68] while The Daily Telegraph described the lead actors as \"newly liberated and energised, eager to give all they have to what's left of the series\".[69] In December 2008, Watson stated she wanted to go to university after she completed the Potter series.[16] Watson's filming for the final instalment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, began on 18 February 2009[70] and ended on 12 June 2010.[71] For financial and scripting reasons, the original book was divided into two films which were shot consecutively.[72][15] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 was released in November 2010 while the second film was released in July 2011.[73] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 became a commercial and critical success. The highest-grossing film in the franchise, it grossed more than $1.3 billion worldwide and proved to be Watson's most commercially successful film yet. She also appeared in a music video for One Night Only, after meeting lead singer George Craig at the 2010 Winter/Summer Burberry advertising campaign. The video, Say You Don't Want It, was screened on Channel 4 on 26 June 2010 and released on 16 August.[74] In her first post-Harry Potter film, Watson appeared in 2011's My Week with Marilyn as Lucy, a wardrobe assistant who is flirted with by the main character, Colin Clark, and has a few dates with him.[75][76] In May 2010, Watson was reported to be in talks to star in a film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower.[77] Filming began in summer 2011, and the film was released in September 2012.[78] In The Bling Ring (2013), Watson stars as Nicki. The film is based on the real-life Bling Ring robberies, with Watson playing a fictionalised version of Alexis Neiers, a television personality who was one of seven teenagers involved in the robberies. While the film mostly received mixed reviews, critics gave almost unanimous praise for Watson's portrayal. Watson also had a supporting role in the apocalyptic comedy This Is the End (2013), in which she, Seth Rogen, James Franco and many others played \"exaggerated versions of themselves\"[79] and Watson memorably dropped the \"f-bomb\".[80] She said she could not pass up the opportunity to make her first comedy and \"work with some of the best comedians ... in the world right now\".[81] In June 2012, Watson was confirmed for the role as Ila in Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which began filming the following month, and was released in March 2014.[82] In March 2013, it was reported that Watson was in negotiations to star as the title character in a live-action Disney adaptation of Cinderella.[83] Kenneth Branagh was attached to direct the adaptation, while Cate Blanchett had reportedly agreed to play the evil stepmother. Watson was offered the role, but turned it down because she did not connect with the character.[84][85] The role ultimately went to Lily James.[86] In October 2013, Watson was chosen as the Woman of the Year by British GQ.[87] That same month, she was one of two British actors to land atop a readers' poll of the sexiest movie stars of 2013, beating Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Lawrence for the actresses' title in an online poll of more than 50,000 film fans. Benedict Cumberbatch took the men's vote.[88] Watson joined Judi Dench, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Leigh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Mark Ruffalo as recipients of the 2014 Britannia Awards, presented on 30 October in Los Angeles. Watson won for British Artist of the Year and dedicated her award to Millie, her pet hamster who died as Watson filmed Philosopher's Stone.[89] Watson starred in two 2015 releases, the thriller films Colonia, opposite Daniel Br\u00fchl and Michael Nyqvist;[90] and Regression by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar, alongside Ethan Hawke and her Harry Potter colleague David Thewlis.[91][92] Both received generally negative reviews.[93][94] She also appeared in an episode of The Vicar of Dibley, in which she played Reverend Iris.[95] In February 2016, Watson announced she was taking a year-long break from acting. She planned to spend the time on her \"personal development\" and her women's rights work.[96] Watson played Belle in the 2017 live action Disney adaptation of Beauty and the Beast directed by Bill Condon, and starring opposite Dan Stevens as the Beast.[97] The film earned over $1.2\u00a0billion at the box office and emerged as the second highest-grossing film of 2017, behind only Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time. Her reported fee was $3\u00a0million upfront with profit participation bringing her total to $15\u00a0million.[98] Later that year, she starred opposite Tom Hanks in the film adaptation of Dave Eggers's novel The Circle, playing Mae Holland, a young tech worker who takes a job at a powerful Internet corporation, only to find herself in a perilous situation concerning privacy, surveillance and freedom.[99] In 2019, Watson starred as Meg March (replacing Emma Stone, who dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts) in Greta Gerwig's film adaptation of Little Women, co-starring with Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Laura Dern, and Meryl Streep.[100] In 2005, Watson began her modelling career with a photo shoot for Teen Vogue and was the youngest person ever to appear on its cover.[2] Three years later, the British press reported that Watson was to replace Keira Knightley as the face of the fashion house Chanel, but this was denied by both parties.[101] In June 2009, following several months of rumours, Watson confirmed that she would be partnering with Burberry as the face of their Autumn/Winter 2009 campaign, for which she received an estimated six-figure fee.[102][103] She also appeared in Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign alongside her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and model Max Hurd.[104] In February 2011, Watson was awarded the Style Icon award from British Elle by Dame Vivienne Westwood.[105] Watson continued her involvement in fashion advertising when she announced she had been chosen as the face of Lanc\u00f4me in March 2011.[106] In September 2009, Watson announced her involvement with People Tree, a Fair trade fashion brand.[107] Watson worked as a creative adviser for the company to create a spring line of clothing, which was released in February 2010;[107][108] the range featured styles inspired by southern France and London.[108][109] The collection, described by The Times as \"very clever\" despite their \"quiet hope that [she] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle\",[110] was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue,[111] Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration,[112] admitted that competition for the range was minimal,[110] but argued that \"Fashion is a great way to empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in\"; adding, \"I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there.\"[110] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.[113] Watson was awarded Best British Style at the 2014 British Fashion Awards. The competition included David Beckham, Amal Clooney, Kate Moss and Keira Knightley.[114] Watson has promoted education for girls, visiting Bangladesh and Zambia to do so.[115] In July 2014, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador.[116] In September that year, an admittedly nervous Watson[117] delivered an address at UN Headquarters in New York City to launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate for gender equality. In that speech she said she began questioning gender-based assumptions at age eight when she was called \"bossy\" (a trait she has attributed[118] to her being a \"perfectionist\") whilst boys were not, and at 14 when she was \"sexualised by certain elements of the media\".[119] Watson's speech also called feminism \"the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities\" and declared that the perception of \"man-hating\" is something that \"has to stop\".[117] Watson later said she received threats within 12 hours of making the speech, which left her \"raging. ... If they were trying to put me off [women's rights work], it did the opposite\".[120] In 2015, Malala Yousafzai told Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech.[121] Also in September, Watson made her first country visit as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador to Uruguay where she gave a speech highlighting the need for women's political participation.[122] In December, the Ms. Foundation for Women named Watson its Feminist Celebrity of 2014 following an online poll.[123] Watson also gave a speech about gender equality in January 2015, at the World Economic Forum's annual winter meeting.[124] Watson took the top spot on the AskMen \"Top 99 Outstanding Women 2015\" list on the strength of having \"thrown her back\" into women's rights issues.[125] The day after she turned 25, Watson placed number 26 on the TIME 100 list of the world's most influential people, her first-ever appearance on the list. For its recap, former New York Times editor Jill Abramson noted Watson's \"gutsy, smart take on feminism\" and called the effort to get men involved \"refreshing\".[126] In January 2016, Watson started a feminist Goodreads book club: Our Shared Shelf.[127] The goal of the club is to share feminist ideas and encourage discussion on the topic. One book is selected per month and is discussed in the last week of that month.[127] The first book to be selected was My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem, whom Watson would later interview on 24 February at the How to: Academy in London.[128][129] Watson was criticised in March 2017 for a photograph published by Vanity Fair in which her breasts are partly visible; some in the news media accused Watson of hypocrisy. She was bemused by the backlash, arguing that feminism \"is not a stick with which to beat other women\" but is instead about freedom, liberation and equality, commenting \"I really don't see what my tits have to do with it\".[130] In July 2019, Watson helped to launch a legal advice line for people who have suffered sexual harassment at work. Legal advice is provided by Rights of Women, a charity which works to help women through the law.[131] Watson is single, which she described in 2019 with the self-coined phrase \"self-partnered\".[132][133] While working on the film Noah, Watson was questioned about her faith, and she described herself as a spiritual Universalist.[134] Marai Larasi, an activist on the issue of violence against women, was her guest to the 75th Golden Globe Awards in 2018.[135]",

Born in Paris and brought up in Oxfordshire, Watson attended the Dragon School and trained as an actress at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. As a child, she rose to prominence with her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, having acted only in school plays previously.\nWatson also appeared in the 2007 television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes and lent her voice to The Tale of Despereaux (2008). After the last Harry Potter film, she took on starring and supporting roles in My Week with Marilyn (2011), The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) and The Bling Ring (2013), made an appearance as an exaggerated version of herself in This Is the End (2013), and portrayed the titular character's adopted daughter in Noah (2014). She went on to star as Belle in the musical romantic fantasy Beauty and the Beast (2017) and Meg March in the coming-of-age film Little Women (2019). Her other film roles include Regression (2015), Colonia (2015), and The Circle (2017).\nFrom 2011 to 2014, Watson split her time between working on films and continuing her education, studying at Brown University and Worcester College, Oxford, and graduating from Brown with a bachelor's degree in English literature in May 2014. Her modelling work has included campaigns for Burberry and Lanc\u00f4me. She also lent her name to a line of clothing for People Tree. She was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2014, winning British Artist of the Year. That same year, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador and helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which encourages all genders to work towards gender equality.\nWatson was born in Paris, France, the daughter of English lawyers Jacqueline Luesby and Chris Watson.[3][4][5] Watson lived in Maisons-Laffitte near Paris until she was five. Her parents divorced when she was young, and Watson moved to England to live with her mother in Oxfordshire while spending weekends at her father's house in London.[3][6] Watson has said she speaks some French, though \"not as well\" as she used to.[7] After moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, she attended the Dragon School, remaining there until 2003.[3] From age six, she wanted to become an actress,[8] and trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing, and acting.[9]\nBy age 10, Watson had performed in Stagecoach productions and school plays including Arthur: The Young Years and The Happy Prince,[10] but she had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series. After the Dragon School, Watson moved on to Headington School, Oxford.[3] While on film sets, she and her peers were tutored for up to five hours a day.[11] In June 2006, she took GCSE school examinations in 10 subjects, achieving eight A* and two A grades. In May 2007, she took AS levels in English, Geography, Art, and History of Art. The next year, she dropped History of Art to pursue the three A levels, receiving an A grade in each subject.[3][12][13]\nWatson took a gap year after leaving high school,[14] to film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows beginning in February 2009,[15] but said she intended to continue her studies[16] and later confirmed that she had chosen Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.[17] In March 2011, after 18 months at the university, Watson announced that she was deferring her course for \"a semester or two\",[18] though she attended Worcester College, Oxford during the 2011\u201312 academic year as part of the Visiting Student Programme.[19][20]\nWatson told Ellen DeGeneres just before graduation that it took five years to finish instead of four because, owing to her acting work, she \"ended up taking two full semesters off\".[21] On 25 May 2014, she graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[22] In 2013, she became certified to teach yoga and meditation. As part of this certification, she attended a week-long meditation course at a Canadian facility, in which residents are not allowed to speak, in order \"to figure out how to be at home with myself\".[23][24] She told Elle Australia that an uncertain future meant finding \"a way to always feel safe and at home within myself. Because I can never rely on a physical place.\"[25]\nIn 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), the film adaptation of British author J. K. Rowling's best-selling novel. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were impressed by her confidence. After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint that they had been cast for the roles of the school friends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test.[8]\nThe release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2001 was Watson's debut screen performance. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001.[26][27] Critics praised the performances of the three leads, often singling out Watson for particular acclaim; The Daily Telegraph called her performance \"admirable\",[28] and IGN said she \"stole the show\".[29] Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in Philosopher's Stone, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress.[30]\nA year later, Watson again starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers praised the lead actors' performances. The Los Angeles Times said Watson and her peers had matured between films,[31] while The Times criticised director Chris Columbus for \"under-employing\" Watson's hugely popular character.[32] Watson received an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo for her performance.[33]\nIn 2004, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released. Watson was appreciative of the more assertive role Hermione played, calling her character \"charismatic\" and \"a fantastic role to play\".[34] Although critics panned Radcliffe's performance, labelling him \"wooden\", they praised Watson; The New York Times lauded her performance, saying: \"Luckily Mr. Radcliffe's blandness is offset by Ms. Watson's spiky impatience. Harry may show off his expanding wizardly skills ... but Hermione ... earns the loudest applause with a decidedly unmagical punch to Draco Malfoy's deserving nose.\"[35] Although Prisoner of Azkaban proved to be the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film of the entire series, Watson's personal performance won her two Otto Awards and the Child Performance of the Year award from Total Film.[36][37]\nWith Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), both Watson and the Harry Potter film series reached new milestones. The film set records for a Harry Potter opening weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK. Critics praised the increasing maturity of Watson and her teenage co-stars; The New York Times called her performance \"touchingly earnest\".[38] For Watson, much of the humour of the film sprang from the tension among the three lead characters as they matured. She said, \"I loved all the arguing. ... I think it's much more realistic that they would argue and that there would be problems.\"[39] Nominated for three awards for Goblet of Fire, Watson won a bronze Otto Award.[40][41] Later that year, Watson became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Teen Vogue,[42] an appearance she reprised in August 2009.[43] In 2006, Watson played Hermione in The Queen's Handbag, a special mini-episode of Harry Potter in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday.[44]\nThe fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released in 2007. A huge financial success, the film set a record worldwide opening-weekend gross of $332.7\u00a0million.[45] Watson won the inaugural National Movie Award for Best Female Performance.[46] As the fame of the actress and the series continued, Watson and fellow Harry Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint left imprints of their hands, feet and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on 9 July 2007.[47]\nBy July 2007, Watson's work in the Harry Potter series was said to have earned her more than \u00a310\u00a0million, and she acknowledged she would never have to work for money again.[48] In March 2009, she was ranked 6th on the Forbes list of \"Most Valuable Young Stars\",[49] and in February 2010, she was named as Hollywood's highest paid female star, having earned an estimated \u00a319\u00a0million in 2009.[50]\nDespite the success of Order of the Phoenix, the future of the Harry Potter franchise became surrounded in doubt, as all three lead actors were hesitant to sign on to continue their roles for the final two episodes.[51] Radcliffe eventually signed for the final films on 2 March 2007,[51] but Watson was considerably more hesitant.[52] She explained that the decision was significant, as the films represented a further four-year commitment to the role, but eventually conceded that she \"could never let [the role of] Hermione go\",[53] signing for the role on 23 March 2007.[54]\nWatson's first non-Potter role was the 2007 BBC film Ballet Shoes, an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Noel Streatfeild.[55][56] The film's director, Sandra Goldbacher, commented that Watson was \"perfect\" for the starring role of aspiring actress Pauline Fossil: \"She has a piercing, delicate aura that makes you want to gaze and gaze at her.\"[57] Ballet Shoes was broadcast in the UK on Boxing Day 2007 to an audience of 5.7\u00a0million viewers, to mixed reviews.[58][59][60]\nWatson also lent her voice to the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale of Despereaux, a children's comedy starring Matthew Broderick, with Harry Potter co-star Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) also starring in the film.[61] The Tale of Despereaux was released in December 2008 and grossed $87\u00a0million worldwide.[62]\nPrincipal photography for the sixth Harry Potter film began in late 2007, with Watson's part being filmed from 18 December to 17 May 2008.[63][64] Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince premiered on 15 July 2009,[65] having been delayed from November 2008.[66] With the lead actors now in their late teens, critics were increasingly willing to review them on the same level as the rest of the film's all-star cast, which the Los Angeles Times described as \"a comprehensive guide to contemporary UK acting\".[67] The Washington Post felt Watson to have given \"[her] most charming performance to date\",[68] while The Daily Telegraph described the lead actors as \"newly liberated and energised, eager to give all they have to what's left of the series\".[69] In December 2008, Watson stated she wanted to go to university after she completed the Potter series.[16]\nWatson's filming for the final instalment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, began on 18 February 2009[70] and ended on 12 June 2010.[71] For financial and scripting reasons, the original book was divided into two films which were shot consecutively.[72][15] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 was released in November 2010 while the second film was released in July 2011.[73] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 became a commercial and critical success. The highest-grossing film in the franchise, it grossed more than $1.3 billion worldwide and proved to be Watson's most commercially successful film yet.\nShe also appeared in a music video for One Night Only, after meeting lead singer George Craig at the 2010 Winter/Summer Burberry advertising campaign. The video, Say You Don't Want It, was screened on Channel 4 on 26 June 2010 and released on 16 August.[74] In her first post-Harry Potter film, Watson appeared in 2011's My Week with Marilyn as Lucy, a wardrobe assistant who is flirted with by the main character, Colin Clark, and has a few dates with him.[75][76]\nIn May 2010, Watson was reported to be in talks to star in a film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower.[77] Filming began in summer 2011, and the film was released in September 2012.[78]\nIn The Bling Ring (2013), Watson stars as Nicki. The film is based on the real-life Bling Ring robberies, with Watson playing a fictionalised version of Alexis Neiers, a television personality who was one of seven teenagers involved in the robberies. While the film mostly received mixed reviews, critics gave almost unanimous praise for Watson's portrayal. Watson also had a supporting role in the apocalyptic comedy This Is the End (2013), in which she, Seth Rogen, James Franco and many others played \"exaggerated versions of themselves\"[79] and Watson memorably dropped the \"f-bomb\".[80] She said she could not pass up the opportunity to make her first comedy and \"work with some of the best comedians ... in the world right now\".[81]\nIn June 2012, Watson was confirmed for the role as Ila in Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which began filming the following month, and was released in March 2014.[82] In March 2013, it was reported that Watson was in negotiations to star as the title character in a live-action Disney adaptation of Cinderella.[83] Kenneth Branagh was attached to direct the adaptation, while Cate Blanchett had reportedly agreed to play the evil stepmother. Watson was offered the role, but turned it down because she did not connect with the character.[84][85] The role ultimately went to Lily James.[86]\nIn October 2013, Watson was chosen as the Woman of the Year by British GQ.[87] That same month, she was one of two British actors to land atop a readers' poll of the sexiest movie stars of 2013, beating Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Lawrence for the actresses' title in an online poll of more than 50,000 film fans. Benedict Cumberbatch took the men's vote.[88]\nWatson joined Judi Dench, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Leigh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Mark Ruffalo as recipients of the 2014 Britannia Awards, presented on 30 October in Los Angeles. Watson won for British Artist of the Year and dedicated her award to Millie, her pet hamster who died as Watson filmed Philosopher's Stone.[89] Watson starred in two 2015 releases, the thriller films Colonia, opposite Daniel Br\u00fchl and Michael Nyqvist;[90] and Regression by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar, alongside Ethan Hawke and her Harry Potter colleague David Thewlis.[91][92] Both received generally negative reviews.[93][94] She also appeared in an episode of The Vicar of Dibley, in which she played Reverend Iris.[95] In February 2016, Watson announced she was taking a year-long break from acting. She planned to spend the time on her \"personal development\" and her women's rights work.[96]\nWatson played Belle in the 2017 live action Disney adaptation of Beauty and the Beast directed by Bill Condon, and starring opposite Dan Stevens as the Beast.[97] The film earned over $1.2\u00a0billion at the box office and emerged as the second highest-grossing film of 2017, behind only Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time. Her reported fee was $3\u00a0million upfront with profit participation bringing her total to $15\u00a0million.[98] Later that year, she starred opposite Tom Hanks in the film adaptation of Dave Eggers's novel The Circle, playing Mae Holland, a young tech worker who takes a job at a powerful Internet corporation, only to find herself in a perilous situation concerning privacy, surveillance and freedom.[99]\nIn 2019, Watson starred as Meg March (replacing Emma Stone, who dropped out of the film due to scheduling conflicts) in Greta Gerwig's film adaptation of Little Women, co-starring with Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Laura Dern, and Meryl Streep.[100]\nIn 2005, Watson began her modelling career with a photo shoot for Teen Vogue and was the youngest person ever to appear on its cover.[2] Three years later, the British press reported that Watson was to replace Keira Knightley as the face of the fashion house Chanel, but this was denied by both parties.[101] In June 2009, following several months of rumours, Watson confirmed that she would be partnering with Burberry as the face of their Autumn/Winter 2009 campaign, for which she received an estimated six-figure fee.[102][103] She also appeared in Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign alongside her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and model Max Hurd.[104] In February 2011, Watson was awarded the Style Icon award from British Elle by Dame Vivienne Westwood.[105] Watson continued her involvement in fashion advertising when she announced she had been chosen as the face of Lanc\u00f4me in March 2011.[106]\nIn September 2009, Watson announced her involvement with People Tree, a Fair trade fashion brand.[107] Watson worked as a creative adviser for the company to create a spring line of clothing, which was released in February 2010;[107][108] the range featured styles inspired by southern France and London.[108][109] The collection, described by The Times as \"very clever\" despite their \"quiet hope that [she] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle\",[110] was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue,[111] Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration,[112] admitted that competition for the range was minimal,[110] but argued that \"Fashion is a great way to empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in\"; adding, \"I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there.\"[110] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.[113]\nWatson was awarded Best British Style at the 2014 British Fashion Awards. The competition included David Beckham, Amal Clooney, Kate Moss and Keira Knightley.[114]\nWatson has promoted education for girls, visiting Bangladesh and Zambia to do so.[115] In July 2014, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador.[116] In September that year, an admittedly nervous Watson[117] delivered an address at UN Headquarters in New York City to launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate for gender equality. In that speech she said she began questioning gender-based assumptions at age eight when she was called \"bossy\" (a trait she has attributed[118] to her being a \"perfectionist\") whilst boys were not, and at 14 when she was \"sexualised by certain elements of the media\".[119] Watson's speech also called feminism \"the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities\" and declared that the perception of \"man-hating\" is something that \"has to stop\".[117] Watson later said she received threats within 12 hours of making the speech, which left her \"raging. ... If they were trying to put me off [women's rights work], it did the opposite\".[120] In 2015, Malala Yousafzai told Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech.[121]\nAlso in September, Watson made her first country visit as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador to Uruguay where she gave a speech highlighting the need for women's political participation.[122] In December, the Ms. Foundation for Women named Watson its Feminist Celebrity of 2014 following an online poll.[123] Watson also gave a speech about gender equality in January 2015, at the World Economic Forum's annual winter meeting.[124]\nWatson took the top spot on the AskMen \"Top 99 Outstanding Women 2015\" list on the strength of having \"thrown her back\" into women's rights issues.[125] The day after she turned 25, Watson placed number 26 on the TIME 100 list of the world's most influential people, her first-ever appearance on the list. For its recap, former New York Times editor Jill Abramson noted Watson's \"gutsy, smart take on feminism\" and called the effort to get men involved \"refreshing\".[126]\nIn January 2016, Watson started a feminist Goodreads book club: Our Shared Shelf.[127] The goal of the club is to share feminist ideas and encourage discussion on the topic. One book is selected per month and is discussed in the last week of that month.[127] The first book to be selected was My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem, whom Watson would later interview on 24 February at the How to: Academy in London.[128][129]\nWatson was criticised in March 2017 for a photograph published by Vanity Fair in which her breasts are partly visible; some in the news media accused Watson of hypocrisy. She was bemused by the backlash, arguing that feminism \"is not a stick with which to beat other women\" but is instead about freedom, liberation and equality, commenting \"I really don't see what my tits have to do with it\".[130]\nIn July 2019, Watson helped to launch a legal advice line for people who have suffered sexual harassment at work. Legal advice is provided by Rights of Women, a charity which works to help women through the law.[131]\nWatson is single, which she described in 2019 with the self-coined phrase \"self-partnered\".[132][133] While working on the film Noah, Watson was questioned about her faith, and she described herself as a spiritual Universalist.[134]\nMarai Larasi, an activist on the issue of violence against women, was her guest to the 75th Golden Globe Awards in 2018.[135]\n\n</body></html>"

Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Aguilera ranked at number 58 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2008, and was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013. With estimated sales of 75 million records, she is one of the world's best-selling music artists. Born in Staten Island of New York City and raised in Pennsylvania, Aguilera appeared on television shows in her early years, before gaining a recording contract with RCA Records in 1998. Her self-titled debut album, released in 1999, reached number one in the US and spawned three US number-one singles: \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\". While recognized as a prominent figure in the contemporary teen pop scene, Aguilera sought to assume artistic control with Stripped (2002) and its lead single \"Dirrty\", which displayed her sexually emancipated persona and generated considerable controversy. The second single from the album, \"Beautiful\", received favorable response for its empowering lyrics and became an anthem for the LGBT community. Aguilera scored her second US number-one album with Back to Basics (2006), which drew inspiration from early 20th-century jazz, soul, and blues, and spawned the top-ten singles \"Ain't No Other Man\", \"Hurt\", and \"Candyman\". Her next three albums, Bionic (2010), Lotus (2012), and Liberation (2018), all experimented with various musical styles and reached the top ten in the US. Besides solo materials, Aguilera earned chart-topping entries with collaborations including \"Lady Marmalade\", \"Moves like Jagger\", \"Feel This Moment\", and \"Say Something\". Alongside her music career, Aguilera starred in the film Burlesque (2010) and was a coach on six seasons of the singing competition television series The Voice from 2011 to 2016. Christina Mar\u00eda Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York City, on December 18, 1980, to musician Shelly Loraine Kearns (n\u00e9e Fidler) and United States Army soldier Fausto Xavier Aguilera.[2] Her father is Ecuadorian[clarify], and her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[3][4] Her family moved frequently because of her father's military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan.[5] Aguilera alleged that her father was physically and emotionally abusive.[6] To cope with her turbulent household, she used music as a form of escape.[7] Following her parents' divorce when she was six years old, Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother moved into her grandmother's home in Rochester, a suburb in the Pittsburgh area.[4] Her mother later remarried and had one more child.[8] After years of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012.[9] As a child, Aguilera was drawn to soul and blues records her grandmother bought and would practice singing, which earned her a reputation as \"the little girl with the big voice\" in her neighborhood.[10] She aspired to be a singer, and won her first talent show at age eight with a rendition of Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\".[5] Aged 10, she performed \"A Sunday Kind of Love\" on the competition show Star Search, and was eliminated during the semi-final round.[7] She performed the song again on KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert.[11] During her youth in the Pittsburgh area, Aguilera sang the US national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, and the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[12] She attended Rochester Area School District in Rochester and Marshall Middle School near Wexford, and briefly attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before being homeschooled to avoid being bullied.[13] In 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The Mickey Mouse Club, although she did not meet its age requirements. She joined the television series two years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994.[14] Fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.[15] After the show ended, Aguilera moved to Japan and recorded her first song, \"All I Wanna Do\", a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi.[16] In 1998, Aguilera returned to the US to seek a recording contract. She approached RCA Records, who told her to contact Disney instead because they were having financial difficulties.[17] She sent her cover version of Whitney Houston's \"Run to You\" to Disney in hopes of being selected to record the theme song \"Reflection\" for their animated film Mulan (1998).[18] Aguilera was ultimately selected to sing \"Reflection\"; the song was released in June 1998 and charted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at number 15.[19] After \"Reflection\", Aguilera attracted the attention of RCA's A&R Ron Fair and was signed with the label quickly afterwards.[20][21] RCA was pressured by the contemporary teen pop craze evoked by Aguilera's peer Britney Spears, leading to the label rushing production of the album and aligning Aguilera to be part of the teen pop trend.[22] They released the lead single off the album, \"Genie in a Bottle\", a trendy pop and R&B track, in June 1999.[22] The single catapulted Aguilera to stardom, peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and charts of 20 other countries.[23] It has sold over seven million copies as of 2014.[24] Aguilera's eponymous debut album followed in August 1999 and peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200.[5] It was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[25] and had moved 17 million copies worldwide by 2010.[26] The album produced three other singles: two US number-one singles\u2013\"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\", and one US top-five single\u2013\"I Turn to You\", a cover of All-4-One's song.[27] At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in February 2000, Aguilera won Best New Artist.[28] Aguiera's two following studio albums, Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas, were released in September and October 2000, respectively.[29] The former, a Spanish-language album consisting of re-recorded versions of tracks on Aguilera's debut album and several original songs, topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums for 19 consecutive weeks and was certified six times platinum in the Latin field by the RIAA.[25][30] It won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2001.[31] The latter contains covers of Christmas popular songs and a few original dance-pop tunes,[32] and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[25] In support of her albums, Aguilera embarked on her first concert tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, from mid-2000 to early 2001. The tour visited North America, Europe, South America, and Japan.[33][34] Billboard in 2000 recognized Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of the Year.[35] Despite the successes, Aguilera was displeased with the music and image her manager Steve Kurtz had aligned her to, feeling unable to control her own image.[36] In October 2000, she filed a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit against Kurtz for improper, undue and inappropriate influence over her professional activities. After terminating Kurtz's services, RCA hired Irving Azoff as Aguilera's new manager.[37] Aguilera took her first steps in artistic control with the 2001 Moulin Rouge! version of Labelle's \"Lady Marmalade\" (1974), a collaboration with Pink, Mya, and Lil Kim, produced by hip hop musicians Missy Elliott and Rockwilder.[10] RCA executives initially opposed to Aguilera recording \"Lady Marmalade\" because it was \"too urban\", but Aguilera ultimately managed to record the song of her own accord.[36] The collaboration topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks based on airplay alone, becoming the first airplay-only track in history to remain on the chart's top spot for more than one week.[38][39] It won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.[40] In mid-2001, Warlock Records released Just Be Free, a compilation of demo tracks Aguilera recorded in 1994 and 1995, when she was looking forward to an album release after the end of The Mickey Mouse Club. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album's producers to stop the release.[41] The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[42] When planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth.[43] She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented \"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\".[44] Aguilera served as the album's executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs.[45][46] To present her new persona, Aguilera chose to release \"Dirrty\" as the lead single from the album in September 2002.[47] Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting overtly sexual fetishes.[48] Aguilera's new image presented in the video was widely criticized by the public that it began to overshadow her music.[49][50][51] She defended her new image: \"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\"[51] Stripped was released in October 2002.[52] The album incorporates various genres from R&B and flamenco to rock, and lyrically revolves around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality.[46][53] It received mixed reviews from music critics, who viewed the employment of various musical styles incoherent, but praised Aguilera's vocals.[52][53] The album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the US as of 2014.[54] In the UK, the album has sold two million copies as of 2017 and was the second highest-selling album by an American female artist during the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me.[55][56] By 2006, Stripped had sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[57] The second single from the album, the ballad \"Beautiful\", received universal acclaim for its empowering lyrics about embracing inner beauty, and became an anthem for the LGBT community.[58][59] It was the album's best-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] The song won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004.[60] Stripped was followed by three other singles: \"Fighter\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\", and \"The Voice Within\", all of which were released in 2003 and entered the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] During promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings.[61][62] She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake's album Justified (2002), before embarking on her solo Stripped Tour until December.[63][64] Aguilera attended the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\", which received considerable media attention.[65] She was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won Best Female award, in November.[66] Billboard announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.[67] In 2004, Aguilera recorded a revised version of Rose Royce's \"Car Wash\" (1976) with Missy Elliott for the animated film Shark Tale, in which she was a voice actress,[68] and contributed vocals to Nelly's single \"Tilt Ya Head Back\".[69] She was a featured artist on Herbie Hancock's 2005 cover of Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\" (1970), which was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2006.[70] During this time, Aguilera started working on her follow-up studio album and embraced a new image inspired by figures of the Classic Hollywood era such as Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, and Mary Pickford, debuting blonde curly hair and retro-styled makeup.[71][72] Aguilera became engaged with marketing executive Jordan Bratman, with whom she had dated since 2003, in February 2005.[73] They married on November 19, 2005, at an estate in Napa County, California.[74] Aguilera released the lead single from her fifth studio album, \"Ain't No Other Man\", in June 2006.[75] The song, like the majority of the album, was inspired by Aguilera's marriage and incorporates elements of early 20th-century soul, blues, and jazz.[76][77] It reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold 1.7 million digital copies in the US as of 2014.[27][54] Its music video saw Aguilera debuting her new alter ego, Baby Jane, inspired by the thriller film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[75] The album, titled Back to Basics, was released in August 2006. Aguilera described the record, a double album, as a \"throwback\" to jazz, blues, and soul music of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s that incorporates \"a modern twist.\"[78] She was much inspired by works of such classic blues and soul singers as Otis Redding, Millie Jackson, and Nina Simone during the recording sessions.[79] Back to Basics received generally positive reviews from critics, who commented that the retro-oriented production complements Aguilera's vocals.[80] It debuted atop the Billboard 200 and has sold 1.7 million copies in the US.[54] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2007, Aguilera won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Ain't No Other Man\", and performed \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" in tribute of the late James Brown.[81] Back to Basics was succeeded by two international top-ten singles: \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\". Two other singles, \"Slow Down Baby\" and \"Oh Mother\", were released exclusively in Australia[82] and Europe,[83] respectively. In support of Back to Basics, Aguilera embarked on the Back to Basics Tour, which ran from November 2006 to October 2008.[84][85][86] With US$48.1 million grossed, the tour was the highest-grossing solo female tour of 2007.[87] In January 2008, Aguilera gave birth to her child with Bratman, a son.[88] Later that year, she appeared in the Martin Scorsese documentary Shine a Light chronicling a two-day Rolling Stones concert in New York City's Beacon Theatre, in which Aguilera performs \"Live with Me\" alongside the band's lead vocalist Mick Jagger.[89] In commemoration of a decade-long career in the music industry, Aguilera released a greatest hits album titled Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits exclusively through Target in November 2008, in the US.[90] In addition to previous singles, it includes four original electropop-oriented songs, two of which are remade versions of two previous singles.[91][92] Aguilera commented that the newly-recorded tracks' \"futurisic, robotic sound\" served as a preview for her follow-up studio album.[93] Keeps Gettin' Better peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, and its titular single \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" charted at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] Billboard in 2009 recognized Aguilera as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s.[94] Aguilera began work on her sixth studio album during pregnancy, when she frequently listened to electronic music.[95] The lead single from the album, \"Not Myself Tonight\", was released in March 2010.[96] Heavily influenced by electronic genres, the song signaled Aguilera's musical experiments on her forthcoming album.[97] It peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] The album, titled Bionic, was released in June 2010. Categorized as a R&B-flavored futurepop album by critics,[98][99] Bionic lyrically revolves around sexual themes while also discussing feminism.[100] Critical reaction to the album was mixed; reviewers commended Aguilera's experimentation with new styles, but found it forced and unnatural.[101][102][103] The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold 332,000 copies in the US as of 2019. [104] The album spawned one other international single, \"You Lost Me\". Two other singles from the album, \"Woohoo\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj and \"I Hate Boys\", were released in the US and Europe,[105][106] and Australia, respectively.[107] Aguilera starred alongside Cher in the musical film Burlesque.[108] Written and directed by Steve Antin, the film was released in theaters in November 2010.[109] Aguilera played Ali Rose, who quits her bar service job and moves to Los Angeles, where she aspires to be a performer in a burlesque club owned by Tess Scali (Cher). Burlesque grossed US$90 million in the box office[110] and received mixed reviews from critics, who found it clich\u00e9d but praised Aguilera's acting.[111] The film received a nomination for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.[112] Aguilera recorded eight tracks for the film's ten-track accompanying soundtrack, and Cher performed the other two.[113] The soundtrack reached number 18 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[25][27] At the Super Bowl XLV in February 2011, Aguilera omitted a few lines while performing the US national anthem.[114] She apologized for the incident, saying: \"I got so caught up in the moment of the song that I lost my place.\"[115] At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, she performed alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch, in a segment that paid tribute to soul singer Aretha Franklin.[116] Aguilera finalized her divorce from Jordan Bratman, from whom she had been separated since September 2010, on April 15, 2011.[117] She concurrently started dating Matthew Rutler, an assistant on the set of Burlesque.[118] From April 2011 to December 2012, Aguilera served as a coach on the first three seasons of the television competition series The Voice.[119] During the first season, Aguilera was featured on Maroon 5's single \"Moves like Jagger\" upon the invitation of the group's lead vocalist and Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Adam Levine. The single peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold seven million digital copies worldwide.[120][121] Upon the third season of The Voice in September 2012, Aguilera released \"Your Body\" as the lead single from her seventh studio album.[122] The single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 34.[123] The album, titled Lotus, followed in November 2012. Aguilera described the record as a \"rebirth\" of herself after the personal struggles she had overcome.[61] Contemporary reviewers found the album generic and conventional, as opposed to Aguilera's previous experimental ventures.[124][125] Lotus peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and has sold 303,000 copies in the US as of 2019. [104] The album was supported by one other single, \"Just a Fool\" featuring Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Blake Shelton.[126] In December 2012, Aguilera was replaced by Shakira for the fourth season of The Voice.[127] She returned for the fifth season in September 2013.[128] In 2013, Aguilera scored three international top-ten singles. She was featured on rapper Pitbull's \"Feel This Moment\", which peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[25][27] She subsequently appeared on Mexican singer Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez's cover of Miguel Gallardo's \"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\" (1976), which earned a diamond certification in Mexico.[129] Aguilera collaborated with A Great Big World on the ballad \"Say Something\", which earned a six-time platinum certification from the RIAA[25] and won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.[130] Aguilera temporarily withdrew from The Voice for the sixth and seventh seasons, citing her desire to devote her time to her family. She was respectively replaced by Shakira and Gwen Stefani during the two seasons.[131][132] After her engagement to Matthew Rutler in February 2014 and the birth of their daughter in August,[133] she returned for the eighth season in October.[134] Aguilera's one more season with The Voice was the tenth, in which she won with her contestant Alisan Porter in May 2016.[135] Aguilera played a recurring role as singer Jade St. John, a pop singer who tries to venture out to country music, on the third season of ABC's musical drama series Nashville in April 2015.[136] She and her partner Rutler served as executive producers for a music-based game show, Tracks, which aired on Spike TV in March 2016.[137] Aguilera recorded a song titled \"Change\", which she dedicated to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting as well as Christina Grimmie, who was fatally shot in Orlando the day before the nightclub shooting. The proceedings were donated to the National Compassion Fund to benefit the victims' families.[138] Her other works included recording a disco song titled \"Telepathy\" featuring Nile Rodgers for the soundtrack of Netflix original series The Get Down (2016),[139] being a voice actress for The Emoji Movie (2017),[140] and starring in the romantic science fiction film Zoe (2018).[141] Aguilera started work on her new album in the summer of 2015.[142][143] Its release was preceded by two singles: \"Accelerate\" featuring Ty Dolla Sign and 2 Chainz and \"Fall in Line\" featuring Demi Lovato.[144][145] The album, titled Liberation, was released in June 15, 2018 to favorable reviews.[146][147][148] Aguilera heavily incorporated R&B and hip hop on the album to represent her desire for freedom from what she described as the \"churning hamster wheel\" that was The Voice.[149] Liberation debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Aguilera's seventh US top-ten album.[150] At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, \"Fall in Line\" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, and the album track \"Like I Do\", which featured GoldLink was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance.[151] To promote Liberation, Aguilera embarked on a US tour, the Liberation Tour, which ran from September to November 2018,[152] and a European tour, The X Tour, which ran from July to December 2019.[153] She also headlined The Xperience, a 16-date concert residency at the Zappos Theater in Las Vegas beginning in May and concluding in October 2019.[154] In 2019, Aguilera received The Disney Legends Awards for \"her remarkable contributions to the Disney legacy\".[155] In October 2019, Aguilera released the song \"Haunted Heart\" from the soundtrack of the computer-animated Addams Family film.[156] Aguilera is a soprano,[157][158][159] possessing a four-octave vocal range spanning from C3 to C\u266f7.[160][161] Since the start of her career Aguilera's voice has been compared to that of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.[162] David Browne writing for The New York Times noted that Aguilera's vocal performance was highly influenced by Carey and Houston, sharing that \"Aguilera has been one of the foremost practitioners of the overpowering, Category 5 vocal style known as melisma\", and \"Ms. Carey, Ms. Houston and Ms. Aguilera, to name its three main champions, are most associated with the period from the late '80s through the late '90s\".[162] A journal by Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times said there are influences of Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin on Aguilera's vocal style, opining that the \"Aguilera's Streisand-esque tendencies\" \"[help Aguilera] figure out how to become the 'great singer' she's been dubbed since she released her first single, the wise-beyond-its-years 'Genie in a Bottle', at 18\".[163] Sasha Frere-Jones wrote in The New Yorker, \"Aguilera doesn't need to reincarnate Sarah Vaughan to be a serious singer. She already is one, in the tradition of nineteen-nineties pop and R&B, skillfully deploying melisma for razzle-dazzle\".[164] In 2003, Aguilera was placed fifth on MTV's \"Best Voices in Music Ever\" list,[165] while ranking atop both COVE and Latina magazine's best Pop and Latina vocalist of all time in 2004 and 2013, respectively.[166][167] In a review for Liberation, Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented on Aguilera's vocal versatility: \"Nothing less than high drama suits Christina Aguilera's voice. She can be brassy, tearful, sultry, gritty, breathy, sweet or furious. She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it's about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow\".[168] Aguilera has, however, been criticized for her excessive use of melisma and oversinging on songs and in concerts.[169][170][171][172] John Eskow of The Huffington Post named Aguilera a main proponent for \"oversouling\", described as the \"gratuitous and confected melisma\".[173] Lucy Davies, a writer for BBC Music, opined that although Aguilera had \"a stunning voice\", she \"could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'y-e-e-eeeh, woah yeh's'\".[174] Longtime producer Linda Perry, who wrote the song \"Beautiful\", revealed about the recording sessions with Aguilera, \"I tried to keep it straight. I told her to get rid of the finger waves. Every time she'd start going into 'hoo-ha', I'd stop the tape. I'm like, 'You're doing it again'\". Perry ended up using the song's first take adding, \"She had a hard time accepting that as the final track. She's a perfectionist. She knows her voice really well, and she knows what's going on. She can hear things that nobody else would catch.\"[175] An editor from Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman, stated that the oversinging on Aguilera's albums was inspired by Carey, writing that \"the Mariah venerators don't get away with it so easily. Aguilera, for one thing, has a slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song\".[170] Aguilera has credited blues singer Etta James as her main influence and inspiration, elaborating, \"Etta is my all-time favorite singer. I've said it for the last seven years \u2013 since I had my first debut record out \u2013 in every interview\".[176] Following James' death in 2012, Aguilera was asked to perform \"At Last\" at James' funeral.[177] Prior to the performance, Aguilera revealed, \"There's a line in this song that says 'I found a dream that I could speak to.' And for me that dream, all my life, has been Etta James\".[178] Other classic artists, including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, are also Aguilera's major influences; her fifth studio album Back to Basics is inspired by vintage jazz, blues and soul music records by them.[179][180][181] Aguilera mentions Whitney Houston as another influence,[182] having performed many of her songs in her early years during talent shows.[5] She also cites Mariah Carey and Celine Dion as an inspiration, and covered the latter's songs: \"These Are the Special Times\" on My Kind of Christmas, and \"The Prayer\" on the NBC reality singing competition The Voice.[183][184] Aguilera's debut album producer Ron Harris revealed that Aguilera during her recording sessions for Christina Aguilera would constantly listen to Brandy's music, studying and trying to replicate her adlibs.[185] According to author Pier Dominguez of the book Christina Aguilera: A Star Is Made, Aguilera stated that Carey and her debut single, \"Vision of Love\" (1990), had the biggest influence on her vocal style.[186] Aguilera points out the musical film The Sound of Music and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, as her first inspiration for singing and performing.[187] At the age of six, the film helped Aguilera cope with her violent childhood, \"Bad things happened in my home; there was violence. The Sound of Music looked like a form of release.\"[7] Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as two biggest inspirations for her image, \"for being re-inventive and being brave as strong females, to explore whatever, even if they do get bad press. It's just like they were fearless.\"[188] During the promotion of Back to Basics, her image was also inspired by the \"Golden age of Hollywood\" actresses including Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, Greta Garbo and Veronica Lake.[189] Aguilera is also inspired by her Burlesque co-star, Cher: \"I have always had tremendous respect for her. She is a woman who did everything before anyone else did it. She is an icon and she inspired me through some of my career. We've had similar costumes too!\"[190] Aguilera frequently blends elements of pop, R&B, dance-pop and soul music into her projects,[191][192][193][194] and her records typically include a combination of ballads and uptempo tracks.[195] Christina Aguilera (1999) prominently displayed teen pop and dance-pop music,[196] while Mi Reflejo (2000) takes inspiration from Latin music.[197] Her first Christmas album, My Kind of Christmas, combines covers of Christmas standards and several original dance-pop tracks.[198] Aiming for musical diversity and artistic growth, Aguilera worked with R&B, rock, hip hop, and Latin music for Stripped (2002).[36][199] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly credited the release with distancing Aguilera from her pop contemporaries.[199] Aguilera leaned towards R&B, blues, jazz, and soul on Back to Basics (2006).[78][200][201] In contrast, Bionic (2010) sees significant use from futuristic electronic music, described as an electropop album.[202][203][204] The soundtrack for her 2010 feature film Burlesque (2010) was influenced by Cabaret, and featured several established songs that were redone as dance numbers in a fashion similar to Moulin Rouge! (2001).[205] Aguilera partnered with mainstream producers including Shellback and Max Martin during production of Lotus (2012); when discussing her interactions with the latter, she commented that \"He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths,\" adding \"Those records were the kind I wanted to stray apart from. If you look at what I did in the past (after my debut), I always try to do things that will challenge me and challenge the listener, too.\"[206] Aguilera stated that she feels a sense of responsibility to reference portions of her personal life so that \"people that can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance.\" Many of her works consequently discuss love; she has also co-written two tracks which dealt with the domestic abuse throughout her childhood.[207] Aguilera has frequently mentioned feminism in her music; she has expressed her belief that sexuality is \"very empowering\", and has commented that \"If I want to be sexual, it's for my own appreciation and enjoyment! That's why I like to talk about the fact that sometimes I am attracted to women. I appreciate their femininity and beauty.\"[208] She has alluded to her physical attractions to women in other interviews as well.[209][210] Her \"Can't Hold Us Down\" from Stripped denounces gender-related double standards, in which men are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave in a similar fashion are disdained.[211] The main theme of Bionic was also about woman empowerment; Hermione Hoby from The Guardian opined that \"she incites more of a sisterly spirit of collaboration, including riot grrrl feminists Le Tigre. Aguilera's not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself.\"[157] In regards to production, Aguilera has often verbalized her preference of working with more \"obscure\" collaborators, and noted that she is not necessarily inclined to contact \"the No.1 chart-toppers in music\" because of their popular demand.[212] The New York Times' Kelefa Sanneh described her decision to work with DJ Premier on Back to Basics as \"a decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely.\"[213] Aguilera has reinvented her public image on numerous occasions throughout her career.[214] In the later 1990s, her then-manager Steve Kurtz marketed her as a bubblegum pop entertainer to capitalize on the genre's financial lure,[43] which earned her recognition as a teen idol.[215] Aguilera introduced her alter ego \"Xtina\" during 2002 and 2003, which presented an increasingly provocative persona.[216][217] During this time, she dyed her hair black, debuted several piercings, and participated in several nude pictorials for publications.[61] In 2004, Aguilera embraced a more \"mature\" image with retro-styled hair and makeup, which was inspired by classic movie stars including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich and Mary Pickford.[72] This reinvention was named \"Baby Jane\" in 2006, an alter ego which was taken from the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.[218] Aguilera received widespread criticism over her curvy figure from gaining weight in 2012.[219] She later received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss in 2013.[220] In 2018, Aguilera appeared bare-faced without makeup and retouching on the cover of Paper magazine and received widespread praise.[221][222] Aguilera is considered a pop icon,[223] and has frequently garnered comparisons to Britney Spears.[224][225] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that Aguilera is \"too eager not to offend\" in her mild-mannered music, making her a \"good girl pretending to be bad\", and also said that Spears' \"artificial-sweetener voice\" was a welcome change of pace from Aguilera's \"numbing vocal gymnastics\".[226] Matthew Horton from Virgin Media suggested that Aguilera was a more impressive performer than Spears despite her lower sales figures.[224] Aguilera has also been regarded as a sex symbol.[164][227] A 2003 issue of Maxim magazine that she covered became its best-selling issue;[228] Aguilera was named \"Sexiest Woman of the Year\" by its subscribers later that year,[229] and also earned the magazine its best-selling issue after posing on the cover that year.[230] Additionally recognized as a gay icon,[231][232] she was the first honoree on The Abbey's Gay Walk of Fame for her contributions to the LGBT community.[233] The music video for \"Beautiful\" earned Aguilera a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayal of the LGBT community.[234] Fashion has also been a part of Aguilera's music career and image.[235] She has frequently worn clothes designed by Roberto Cavalli, John Galliano, Marc Jacobs, and Alexander McQueen.[236][237] During the Back to Basics Tour in 2006, Aguilera performed in a stole made of fur designed by Roberto Cavalli, unaware that it was made from real fur of a white fox. After receiving a video about the treatment of foxes from PETA vice president Dan Mathews, Aguilera replaced it with a faux-fur stole, further stating that she was \"very upset\" because she \"only ever wears fake fur\".[238] Aguilera's costumes from Burlesque were featured in the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising's Art of Motion Picture Costume Design exhibition.[239] Wax figures of Aguilera are located at Madame Tussauds wax museums in London and New York City.[240][241] As of 2018, Aguilera had sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide.[242] Aguilera's works have earned her numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards.[243] Various artists have noted that they were inspired by Aguilera, including Ariana Grande,[244] Tinashe,[245] Lady Gaga[246] Sam Smith,[247] and Lauren Jauregui,[248] among others.[249][250][251] Her work has also inspired some athletes, including American figure skater Johnny Weir[252] and American swimmer Dana Vollmer.[253] Aguilera's use of sexual imagery has helped catalyze public discourse on sexuality and feminism. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, co-founder of The Vagenda, opined that the provocative dance routines in Aguilera's music videos are \"empowering\".[254] Aguilera is also known for her television and music video impact; in 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that Aguilera \"will be remembered for her glamour, her scandalous take on femme-pop and her Brobdingnagian voice, and\u00a0... as the person who almost single-handedly reshaped music-competition reality programming\".[255] She was considered as one of the greatest women of the music video era by VH1.[256] Writing for The Hampton Institute, critic Terry Young, Jr. commented that Aguilera \"redefined the 21st century female pop performer,\" adding that following the release of Stripped, \"artists like Spears and Beyonc\u00e9 became more comfortable expressing sexuality and no longer felt the need to sell the notion of innocence\".[257] In November 2008, Rolling Stone placed Aguilera at number 58 on its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, writing that \"[Aguilera] has had the finesse and power of a blues queen ever since she was a child star\".[258] In November 2010, Aguilera was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[259] In October 2012, Aguilera's costumes and video collection was included on the \"Women Who Rock\" exhibition by the National Museum of Women in the Arts.[260] That same year, VH1 named Aguilera the eighth greatest woman in the music industry.[261] In 2013, Gregory Hicks from The Michigan Daily opined that \"Aguilera deserves to be known as one of the greatest artists to ever hit the pop industry.\"[262] At the 2013 People's Choice Awards, Aguilera was awarded the People's Voice Award, which recognized her ability to reach people across various genres.[263] Also in 2013, Aguilera was one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World. In the article for the magazine, Celine Dion wrote, \"Without a doubt, [Aguilera]'s one of the most talented artists the world has ever seen and heard, and I think she's going to continue to amaze us for many, many years to come.\"[264] In 2019, the Human Rights Campaign honored Aguilera with its \"Ally for Equality\" award. She was recognized as an \"LGBTQ icon\" who used her platform to share a message of hope and inspiration.[265] In 2000, Aguilera supported a program called Come on Over and Do Something, which aimed to \"encourage kids to get involved in their communities and make a difference.\"[266] A year later, she signed a letter from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to the South Korean government requesting that the country stop its alleged killing of dogs for food.[267] In 2010, Aguilera auctioned tickets for her planned tour for Christie's A Bid to Save the Earth, which benefited the non-profit environmental groups Conservation International, Oceana, Natural Resources Defense Council, and The Central Park Conservancy.[268] Aguilera contributed US$200,000 to the Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh in December 2003,[269] and was part of the Lifetime Television's \"End violence against women\" campaign.[270] In 2005, Aguilera contributed \"Beautiful\" to the compilation album Love Rocks, which proceeds benefited the Human Rights Campaign.[271] Aguilera participated in the AIDS Project Los Angeles' Artists Against AIDS \"What's Going On?\" cover project, and became the face for MAC Cosmetics and spokesperson for MAC AIDS Fund in 2004. Singer Elton John featured Aguilera in his charity book 4 Inches, which benefitted the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[272] In the run-up to the 2004 United States presidential election, Aguilera was featured on billboards for the \"Only You Can Silence Yourself\" online voter registration drive run by the nonpartisan, non-profit campaign \"Declare Yourself\". In these political advertisements, shot by David LaChapelle, Aguilera was shown with her mouth sewn shut to symbolize the effects of not voting.[273] In late 2007, Aguilera became the spokesperson for \"Rock the Vote\", through which she encouraged young people to vote in the 2008 presidential election.[274] In 2005, Aguilera donated her wedding gifts to American charities in support of Hurricane Katrina victims,[275] and performed at \"Unite of the Stars\" concert for Unite Against Hunger in Johannesburg, South Africa and for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund at the Coca-Cola Dome.[276] In 2008, Aguilera headlined London's Africa Rising charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which raised awareness for finding substantial issues facing the continent.[277] That year, Aguilera appeared on the Turkish version of Deal or No Deal, Var m\u0131s\u0131n? Yok musun?, and donated proceeds to a charity program for orphans.[278] In 2009, Aguilera became the global spokesperson for World Hunger Relief;[279] she and Bratman traveled to Guatemala with the World Food Programme to bring awareness to issues including its high malnutrition rate, and met with local families and beneficiaries of WFP's nutrition programs.[280] Aguilera has helped raise over $148\u00a0million for WFP and other hunger relief agencies in 45 countries.[281] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Aguilera donated a signed Chrysler 300 which was auctioned for relief efforts.[282] She additionally appeared on the Hope for Haiti telethon that January, where donations directly benefited Oxfam America, Partners In Health, Red Cross and UNICEF.[283] She was featured on a public service announcement alongside former boxer Muhammad Ali to raise funds for the World Food Programme's efforts to bring food to survivors of the earthquake.[284] Aguilera was nominated for a VH1 Do Something Award for her work with the organization and her efforts in response to the earthquake.[285] In 2010, Aguilera was appointed UN ambassador for the World Food Programme.[286] Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Aguilera performed \"Beautiful\" to open the Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together benefit telethon; all proceeds went to the American Red Cross.[287] That year, Aguilera and David Novak received the George McGovern Leadership Award.[288] The following year Aguilera was honored with the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian of the Year Award.[289] In 2000, Aguilera was the face for make-up line Fetish, where she worked in choosing colors and packaging for the line.[290] That same year, an interactive CD-ROM was produced called Christina Aguilera: Follow Your Dreams released by Simon & Schuster Interactive which features games and quizzes, plus Aguilera herself talking about accomplishing her goals.[291] Throughout her career, Aguilera has endorsed several brands, including Sears, Levi's,[292] Skechers,[293] Mercedes-Benz,[294] Versace,[295] Virgin Mobile,[296] Orange UK, Oreo,[297] Sony Ericsson [298] and soft drink giants Coca-Cola,[299] and Pepsi in 2001 and 2006, respectively.[300] In 2004, Aguilera earned \u00a3200,000 (about $300,000) for opening the summer sale at London's Harrods store[301] and appeared in an advertisement for MAC Cosmetics' Viva Glam V campaign.[302] Following the birth of her son in 2008, she was reportedly paid $1.5 million by People for her baby pictures, which became the ninth most expensive celebrity baby photographs ever taken.[303] In 2008, jewelry designer Stephen Webster and friend of Aguilera released \"Shattered\", a collection of sterling silver pieces, through Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.

Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Aguilera ranked at number 58 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2008, and was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013. With estimated sales of 75 million records, she is one of the world's best-selling music artists.\nBorn in Staten Island of New York City and raised in Pennsylvania, Aguilera appeared on television shows in her early years, before gaining a recording contract with RCA Records in 1998. Her self-titled debut album, released in 1999, reached number one in the US and spawned three US number-one singles: \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\". While recognized as a prominent figure in the contemporary teen pop scene, Aguilera sought to assume artistic control with Stripped (2002) and its lead single \"Dirrty\", which displayed her sexually emancipated persona and generated considerable controversy. The second single from the album, \"Beautiful\", received favorable response for its empowering lyrics and became an anthem for the LGBT community.\nAguilera scored her second US number-one album with Back to Basics (2006), which drew inspiration from early 20th-century jazz, soul, and blues, and spawned the top-ten singles \"Ain't No Other Man\", \"Hurt\", and \"Candyman\". Her next three albums, Bionic (2010), Lotus (2012), and Liberation (2018), all experimented with various musical styles and reached the top ten in the US. Besides solo materials, Aguilera earned chart-topping entries with collaborations including \"Lady Marmalade\", \"Moves like Jagger\", \"Feel This Moment\", and \"Say Something\". Alongside her music career, Aguilera starred in the film Burlesque (2010) and was a coach on six seasons of the singing competition television series The Voice from 2011 to 2016.\nChristina Mar\u00eda Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York City, on December 18, 1980, to musician Shelly Loraine Kearns (n\u00e9e Fidler) and United States Army soldier Fausto Xavier Aguilera.[2] Her father is Ecuadorian[clarify], and her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[3][4] Her family moved frequently because of her father's military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan.[5] Aguilera alleged that her father was physically and emotionally abusive.[6] To cope with her turbulent household, she used music as a form of escape.[7] Following her parents' divorce when she was six years old, Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother moved into her grandmother's home in Rochester, a suburb in the Pittsburgh area.[4] Her mother later remarried and had one more child.[8] After years of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012.[9]\nAs a child, Aguilera was drawn to soul and blues records her grandmother bought and would practice singing, which earned her a reputation as \"the little girl with the big voice\" in her neighborhood.[10] She aspired to be a singer, and won her first talent show at age eight with a rendition of Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\".[5] Aged 10, she performed \"A Sunday Kind of Love\" on the competition show Star Search, and was eliminated during the semi-final round.[7] She performed the song again on KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert.[11] During her youth in the Pittsburgh area, Aguilera sang the US national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, and the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[12] She attended Rochester Area School District in Rochester and Marshall Middle School near Wexford, and briefly attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before being homeschooled to avoid being bullied.[13]\nIn 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The Mickey Mouse Club, although she did not meet its age requirements. She joined the television series two years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994.[14] Fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.[15] After the show ended, Aguilera moved to Japan and recorded her first song, \"All I Wanna Do\", a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi.[16] In 1998, Aguilera returned to the US to seek a recording contract. She approached RCA Records, who told her to contact Disney instead because they were having financial difficulties.[17] She sent her cover version of Whitney Houston's \"Run to You\" to Disney in hopes of being selected to record the theme song \"Reflection\" for their animated film Mulan (1998).[18] Aguilera was ultimately selected to sing \"Reflection\"; the song was released in June 1998 and charted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at number 15.[19]\nAfter \"Reflection\", Aguilera attracted the attention of RCA's A&amp;R Ron Fair and was signed with the label quickly afterwards.[20][21] RCA was pressured by the contemporary teen pop craze evoked by Aguilera's peer Britney Spears, leading to the label rushing production of the album and aligning Aguilera to be part of the teen pop trend.[22] They released the lead single off the album, \"Genie in a Bottle\", a trendy pop and R&amp;B track, in June 1999.[22] The single catapulted Aguilera to stardom, peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and charts of 20 other countries.[23] It has sold over seven million copies as of 2014.[24] Aguilera's eponymous debut album followed in August 1999 and peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200.[5] It was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[25] and had moved 17 million copies worldwide by 2010.[26] The album produced three other singles: two US number-one singles\u2013\"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\", and one US top-five single\u2013\"I Turn to You\", a cover of All-4-One's song.[27] At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in February 2000, Aguilera won Best New Artist.[28]\nAguiera's two following studio albums, Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas, were released in September and October 2000, respectively.[29] The former, a Spanish-language album consisting of re-recorded versions of tracks on Aguilera's debut album and several original songs, topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums for 19 consecutive weeks and was certified six times platinum in the Latin field by the RIAA.[25][30] It won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2001.[31] The latter contains covers of Christmas popular songs and a few original dance-pop tunes,[32] and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[25] In support of her albums, Aguilera embarked on her first concert tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, from mid-2000 to early 2001. The tour visited North America, Europe, South America, and Japan.[33][34] Billboard in 2000 recognized Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of the Year.[35] Despite the successes, Aguilera was displeased with the music and image her manager Steve Kurtz had aligned her to, feeling unable to control her own image.[36] In October 2000, she filed a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit against Kurtz for improper, undue and inappropriate influence over her professional activities. After terminating Kurtz's services, RCA hired Irving Azoff as Aguilera's new manager.[37]\nAguilera took her first steps in artistic control with the 2001 Moulin Rouge! version of Labelle's \"Lady Marmalade\" (1974), a collaboration with Pink, Mya, and Lil Kim, produced by hip hop musicians Missy Elliott and Rockwilder.[10] RCA executives initially opposed to Aguilera recording \"Lady Marmalade\" because it was \"too urban\", but Aguilera ultimately managed to record the song of her own accord.[36] The collaboration topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks based on airplay alone, becoming the first airplay-only track in history to remain on the chart's top spot for more than one week.[38][39] It won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.[40] In mid-2001, Warlock Records released Just Be Free, a compilation of demo tracks Aguilera recorded in 1994 and 1995, when she was looking forward to an album release after the end of The Mickey Mouse Club. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album's producers to stop the release.[41] The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[42]\nWhen planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth.[43] She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented \"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\".[44] Aguilera served as the album's executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs.[45][46] To present her new persona, Aguilera chose to release \"Dirrty\" as the lead single from the album in September 2002.[47] Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting overtly sexual fetishes.[48] Aguilera's new image presented in the video was widely criticized by the public that it began to overshadow her music.[49][50][51] She defended her new image: \"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\"[51]\nStripped was released in October 2002.[52] The album incorporates various genres from R&amp;B and flamenco to rock, and lyrically revolves around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality.[46][53] It received mixed reviews from music critics, who viewed the employment of various musical styles incoherent, but praised Aguilera's vocals.[52][53] The album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the US as of 2014.[54] In the UK, the album has sold two million copies as of 2017 and was the second highest-selling album by an American female artist during the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me.[55][56] By 2006, Stripped had sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[57] The second single from the album, the ballad \"Beautiful\", received universal acclaim for its empowering lyrics about embracing inner beauty, and became an anthem for the LGBT community.[58][59] It was the album's best-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] The song won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004.[60]\nStripped was followed by three other singles: \"Fighter\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\", and \"The Voice Within\", all of which were released in 2003 and entered the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] During promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings.[61][62] She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake's album Justified (2002), before embarking on her solo Stripped Tour until December.[63][64] Aguilera attended the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\", which received considerable media attention.[65] She was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won Best Female award, in November.[66] Billboard announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.[67]\nIn 2004, Aguilera recorded a revised version of Rose Royce's \"Car Wash\" (1976) with Missy Elliott for the animated film Shark Tale, in which she was a voice actress,[68] and contributed vocals to Nelly's single \"Tilt Ya Head Back\".[69] She was a featured artist on Herbie Hancock's 2005 cover of Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\" (1970), which was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2006.[70] During this time, Aguilera started working on her follow-up studio album and embraced a new image inspired by figures of the Classic Hollywood era such as Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, and Mary Pickford, debuting blonde curly hair and retro-styled makeup.[71][72]\nAguilera became engaged with marketing executive Jordan Bratman, with whom she had dated since 2003, in February 2005.[73] They married on November 19, 2005, at an estate in Napa County, California.[74] Aguilera released the lead single from her fifth studio album, \"Ain't No Other Man\", in June 2006.[75] The song, like the majority of the album, was inspired by Aguilera's marriage and incorporates elements of early 20th-century soul, blues, and jazz.[76][77] It reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold 1.7 million digital copies in the US as of 2014.[27][54] Its music video saw Aguilera debuting her new alter ego, Baby Jane, inspired by the thriller film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[75]\nThe album, titled Back to Basics, was released in August 2006. Aguilera described the record, a double album, as a \"throwback\" to jazz, blues, and soul music of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s that incorporates \"a modern twist.\"[78] She was much inspired by works of such classic blues and soul singers as Otis Redding, Millie Jackson, and Nina Simone during the recording sessions.[79] Back to Basics received generally positive reviews from critics, who commented that the retro-oriented production complements Aguilera's vocals.[80] It debuted atop the Billboard 200 and has sold 1.7 million copies in the US.[54] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2007, Aguilera won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Ain't No Other Man\", and performed \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" in tribute of the late James Brown.[81] Back to Basics was succeeded by two international top-ten singles: \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\". Two other singles, \"Slow Down Baby\" and \"Oh Mother\", were released exclusively in Australia[82] and Europe,[83] respectively. In support of Back to Basics, Aguilera embarked on the Back to Basics Tour, which ran from November 2006 to October 2008.[84][85][86] With US$48.1 million grossed, the tour was the highest-grossing solo female tour of 2007.[87]\nIn January 2008, Aguilera gave birth to her child with Bratman, a son.[88] Later that year, she appeared in the Martin Scorsese documentary Shine a Light chronicling a two-day Rolling Stones concert in New York City's Beacon Theatre, in which Aguilera performs \"Live with Me\" alongside the band's lead vocalist Mick Jagger.[89] In commemoration of a decade-long career in the music industry, Aguilera released a greatest hits album titled Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits exclusively through Target in November 2008, in the US.[90] In addition to previous singles, it includes four original electropop-oriented songs, two of which are remade versions of two previous singles.[91][92] Aguilera commented that the newly-recorded tracks' \"futurisic, robotic sound\" served as a preview for her follow-up studio album.[93] Keeps Gettin' Better peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, and its titular single \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" charted at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] Billboard in 2009 recognized Aguilera as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s.[94]\nAguilera began work on her sixth studio album during pregnancy, when she frequently listened to electronic music.[95] The lead single from the album, \"Not Myself Tonight\", was released in March 2010.[96] Heavily influenced by electronic genres, the song signaled Aguilera's musical experiments on her forthcoming album.[97] It peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] The album, titled Bionic, was released in June 2010. Categorized as a R&amp;B-flavored futurepop album by critics,[98][99] Bionic lyrically revolves around sexual themes while also discussing feminism.[100] Critical reaction to the album was mixed; reviewers commended Aguilera's experimentation with new styles, but found it forced and unnatural.[101][102][103] The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold 332,000 copies in the US as of 2019. [104] The album spawned one other international single, \"You Lost Me\". Two other singles from the album, \"Woohoo\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj and \"I Hate Boys\", were released in the US and Europe,[105][106] and Australia, respectively.[107]\nAguilera starred alongside Cher in the musical film Burlesque.[108] Written and directed by Steve Antin, the film was released in theaters in November 2010.[109] Aguilera played Ali Rose, who quits her bar service job and moves to Los Angeles, where she aspires to be a performer in a burlesque club owned by Tess Scali (Cher). Burlesque grossed US$90 million in the box office[110] and received mixed reviews from critics, who found it clich\u00e9d but praised Aguilera's acting.[111] The film received a nomination for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.[112] Aguilera recorded eight tracks for the film's ten-track accompanying soundtrack, and Cher performed the other two.[113] The soundtrack reached number 18 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[25][27]\nAt the Super Bowl XLV in February 2011, Aguilera omitted a few lines while performing the US national anthem.[114] She apologized for the incident, saying: \"I got so caught up in the moment of the song that I lost my place.\"[115] At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, she performed alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch, in a segment that paid tribute to soul singer Aretha Franklin.[116] Aguilera finalized her divorce from Jordan Bratman, from whom she had been separated since September 2010, on April 15, 2011.[117] She concurrently started dating Matthew Rutler, an assistant on the set of Burlesque.[118] From April 2011 to December 2012, Aguilera served as a coach on the first three seasons of the television competition series The Voice.[119] During the first season, Aguilera was featured on Maroon 5's single \"Moves like Jagger\" upon the invitation of the group's lead vocalist and Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Adam Levine. The single peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold seven million digital copies worldwide.[120][121]\nUpon the third season of The Voice in September 2012, Aguilera released \"Your Body\" as the lead single from her seventh studio album.[122] The single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 34.[123] The album, titled Lotus, followed in November 2012. Aguilera described the record as a \"rebirth\" of herself after the personal struggles she had overcome.[61] Contemporary reviewers found the album generic and conventional, as opposed to Aguilera's previous experimental ventures.[124][125] Lotus peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and has sold 303,000 copies in the US as of 2019. [104] The album was supported by one other single, \"Just a Fool\" featuring Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Blake Shelton.[126] In December 2012, Aguilera was replaced by Shakira for the fourth season of The Voice.[127] She returned for the fifth season in September 2013.[128]\nIn 2013, Aguilera scored three international top-ten singles. She was featured on rapper Pitbull's \"Feel This Moment\", which peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[25][27] She subsequently appeared on Mexican singer Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez's cover of Miguel Gallardo's \"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\" (1976), which earned a diamond certification in Mexico.[129] Aguilera collaborated with A Great Big World on the ballad \"Say Something\", which earned a six-time platinum certification from the RIAA[25] and won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.[130] Aguilera temporarily withdrew from The Voice for the sixth and seventh seasons, citing her desire to devote her time to her family. She was respectively replaced by Shakira and Gwen Stefani during the two seasons.[131][132] After her engagement to Matthew Rutler in February 2014 and the birth of their daughter in August,[133] she returned for the eighth season in October.[134] Aguilera's one more season with The Voice was the tenth, in which she won with her contestant Alisan Porter in May 2016.[135]\nAguilera played a recurring role as singer Jade St. John, a pop singer who tries to venture out to country music, on the third season of ABC's musical drama series Nashville in April 2015.[136] She and her partner Rutler served as executive producers for a music-based game show, Tracks, which aired on Spike TV in March 2016.[137] Aguilera recorded a song titled \"Change\", which she dedicated to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting as well as Christina Grimmie, who was fatally shot in Orlando the day before the nightclub shooting. The proceedings were donated to the National Compassion Fund to benefit the victims' families.[138] Her other works included recording a disco song titled \"Telepathy\" featuring Nile Rodgers for the soundtrack of Netflix original series The Get Down (2016),[139] being a voice actress for The Emoji Movie (2017),[140] and starring in the romantic science fiction film Zoe (2018).[141]\nAguilera started work on her new album in the summer of 2015.[142][143] Its release was preceded by two singles: \"Accelerate\" featuring Ty Dolla Sign and 2 Chainz and \"Fall in Line\" featuring Demi Lovato.[144][145] The album, titled Liberation, was released in June 15, 2018 to favorable reviews.[146][147][148] Aguilera heavily incorporated R&amp;B and hip hop on the album to represent her desire for freedom from what she described as the \"churning hamster wheel\" that was The Voice.[149] Liberation debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Aguilera's seventh US top-ten album.[150] At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, \"Fall in Line\" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, and the album track \"Like I Do\", which featured GoldLink was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance.[151]\nTo promote Liberation, Aguilera embarked on a US tour, the Liberation Tour, which ran from September to November 2018,[152] and a European tour, The X Tour, which ran from July to December 2019.[153] She also headlined The Xperience, a 16-date concert residency at the Zappos Theater in Las Vegas beginning in May and concluding in October 2019.[154] In 2019, Aguilera received The Disney Legends Awards for \"her remarkable contributions to the Disney legacy\".[155] In October 2019, Aguilera released the song \"Haunted Heart\" from the soundtrack of the computer-animated Addams Family film.[156]\nAguilera is a soprano,[157][158][159] possessing a four-octave vocal range spanning from C3 to C\u266f7.[160][161] Since the start of her career Aguilera's voice has been compared to that of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.[162] David Browne writing for The New York Times noted that Aguilera's vocal performance was highly influenced by Carey and Houston, sharing that \"Aguilera has been one of the foremost practitioners of the overpowering, Category 5 vocal style known as melisma\", and \"Ms. Carey, Ms. Houston and Ms. Aguilera, to name its three main champions, are most associated with the period from the late '80s through the late '90s\".[162] A journal by Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times said there are influences of Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin on Aguilera's vocal style, opining that the \"Aguilera's Streisand-esque tendencies\" \"[help Aguilera] figure out how to become the 'great singer' she's been dubbed since she released her first single, the wise-beyond-its-years 'Genie in a Bottle', at 18\".[163] Sasha Frere-Jones wrote in The New Yorker, \"Aguilera doesn't need to reincarnate Sarah Vaughan to be a serious singer. She already is one, in the tradition of nineteen-nineties pop and R&amp;B, skillfully deploying melisma for razzle-dazzle\".[164] In 2003, Aguilera was placed fifth on MTV's \"Best Voices in Music Ever\" list,[165] while ranking atop both COVE and Latina magazine's best Pop and Latina vocalist of all time in 2004 and 2013, respectively.[166][167] In a review for Liberation, Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented on Aguilera's vocal versatility: \"Nothing less than high drama suits Christina Aguilera's voice. She can be brassy, tearful, sultry, gritty, breathy, sweet or furious. She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it's about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow\".[168]\nAguilera has, however, been criticized for her excessive use of melisma and oversinging on songs and in concerts.[169][170][171][172] John Eskow of The Huffington Post named Aguilera a main proponent for \"oversouling\", described as the \"gratuitous and confected melisma\".[173] Lucy Davies, a writer for BBC Music, opined that although Aguilera had \"a stunning voice\", she \"could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'y-e-e-eeeh, woah yeh's'\".[174] Longtime producer Linda Perry, who wrote the song \"Beautiful\", revealed about the recording sessions with Aguilera, \"I tried to keep it straight. I told her to get rid of the finger waves. Every time she'd start going into 'hoo-ha', I'd stop the tape. I'm like, 'You're doing it again'\". Perry ended up using the song's first take adding, \"She had a hard time accepting that as the final track. She's a perfectionist. She knows her voice really well, and she knows what's going on. She can hear things that nobody else would catch.\"[175] An editor from Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman, stated that the oversinging on Aguilera's albums was inspired by Carey, writing that \"the Mariah venerators don't get away with it so easily. Aguilera, for one thing, has a slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song\".[170]\nAguilera has credited blues singer Etta James as her main influence and inspiration, elaborating, \"Etta is my all-time favorite singer. I've said it for the last seven years \u2013 since I had my first debut record out \u2013 in every interview\".[176] Following James' death in 2012, Aguilera was asked to perform \"At Last\" at James' funeral.[177] Prior to the performance, Aguilera revealed, \"There's a line in this song that says 'I found a dream that I could speak to.' And for me that dream, all my life, has been Etta James\".[178] Other classic artists, including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, are also Aguilera's major influences; her fifth studio album Back to Basics is inspired by vintage jazz, blues and soul music records by them.[179][180][181]\nAguilera mentions Whitney Houston as another influence,[182] having performed many of her songs in her early years during talent shows.[5] She also cites Mariah Carey and Celine Dion as an inspiration, and covered the latter's songs: \"These Are the Special Times\" on My Kind of Christmas, and \"The Prayer\" on the NBC reality singing competition The Voice.[183][184] Aguilera's debut album producer Ron Harris revealed that Aguilera during her recording sessions for Christina Aguilera would constantly listen to Brandy's music, studying and trying to replicate her adlibs.[185] According to author Pier Dominguez of the book Christina Aguilera: A Star Is Made, Aguilera stated that Carey and her debut single, \"Vision of Love\" (1990), had the biggest influence on her vocal style.[186] Aguilera points out the musical film The Sound of Music and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, as her first inspiration for singing and performing.[187] At the age of six, the film helped Aguilera cope with her violent childhood, \"Bad things happened in my home; there was violence. The Sound of Music looked like a form of release.\"[7] Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as two biggest inspirations for her image, \"for being re-inventive and being brave as strong females, to explore whatever, even if they do get bad press. It's just like they were fearless.\"[188] During the promotion of Back to Basics, her image was also inspired by the \"Golden age of Hollywood\" actresses including Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, Greta Garbo and Veronica Lake.[189] Aguilera is also inspired by her Burlesque co-star, Cher: \"I have always had tremendous respect for her. She is a woman who did everything before anyone else did it. She is an icon and she inspired me through some of my career. We've had similar costumes too!\"[190]\nAguilera frequently blends elements of pop, R&amp;B, dance-pop and soul music into her projects,[191][192][193][194] and her records typically include a combination of ballads and uptempo tracks.[195] Christina Aguilera (1999) prominently displayed teen pop and dance-pop music,[196] while Mi Reflejo (2000) takes inspiration from Latin music.[197] Her first Christmas album, My Kind of Christmas, combines covers of Christmas standards and several original dance-pop tracks.[198] Aiming for musical diversity and artistic growth, Aguilera worked with R&amp;B, rock, hip hop, and Latin music for Stripped (2002).[36][199] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly credited the release with distancing Aguilera from her pop contemporaries.[199] Aguilera leaned towards R&amp;B, blues, jazz, and soul on Back to Basics (2006).[78][200][201]\nIn contrast, Bionic (2010) sees significant use from futuristic electronic music, described as an electropop album.[202][203][204] The soundtrack for her 2010 feature film Burlesque (2010) was influenced by Cabaret, and featured several established songs that were redone as dance numbers in a fashion similar to Moulin Rouge! (2001).[205] Aguilera partnered with mainstream producers including Shellback and Max Martin during production of Lotus (2012); when discussing her interactions with the latter, she commented that \"He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths,\" adding \"Those records were the kind I wanted to stray apart from. If you look at what I did in the past (after my debut), I always try to do things that will challenge me and challenge the listener, too.\"[206]\nAguilera stated that she feels a sense of responsibility to reference portions of her personal life so that \"people that can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance.\" Many of her works consequently discuss love; she has also co-written two tracks which dealt with the domestic abuse throughout her childhood.[207] Aguilera has frequently mentioned feminism in her music; she has expressed her belief that sexuality is \"very empowering\", and has commented that \"If I want to be sexual, it's for my own appreciation and enjoyment! That's why I like to talk about the fact that sometimes I am attracted to women. I appreciate their femininity and beauty.\"[208] She has alluded to her physical attractions to women in other interviews as well.[209][210] Her \"Can't Hold Us Down\" from Stripped denounces gender-related double standards, in which men are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave in a similar fashion are disdained.[211] The main theme of Bionic was also about woman empowerment; Hermione Hoby from The Guardian opined that \"she incites more of a sisterly spirit of collaboration, including riot grrrl feminists Le Tigre. Aguilera's not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself.\"[157] In regards to production, Aguilera has often verbalized her preference of working with more \"obscure\" collaborators, and noted that she is not necessarily inclined to contact \"the No.1 chart-toppers in music\" because of their popular demand.[212] The New York Times' Kelefa Sanneh described her decision to work with DJ Premier on Back to Basics as \"a decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely.\"[213]\nAguilera has reinvented her public image on numerous occasions throughout her career.[214] In the later 1990s, her then-manager Steve Kurtz marketed her as a bubblegum pop entertainer to capitalize on the genre's financial lure,[43] which earned her recognition as a teen idol.[215] Aguilera introduced her alter ego \"Xtina\" during 2002 and 2003, which presented an increasingly provocative persona.[216][217] During this time, she dyed her hair black, debuted several piercings, and participated in several nude pictorials for publications.[61] In 2004, Aguilera embraced a more \"mature\" image with retro-styled hair and makeup, which was inspired by classic movie stars including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich and Mary Pickford.[72] This reinvention was named \"Baby Jane\" in 2006, an alter ego which was taken from the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.[218] Aguilera received widespread criticism over her curvy figure from gaining weight in 2012.[219] She later received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss in 2013.[220] In 2018, Aguilera appeared bare-faced without makeup and retouching on the cover of Paper magazine and received widespread praise.[221][222]\nAguilera is considered a pop icon,[223] and has frequently garnered comparisons to Britney Spears.[224][225] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that Aguilera is \"too eager not to offend\" in her mild-mannered music, making her a \"good girl pretending to be bad\", and also said that Spears' \"artificial-sweetener voice\" was a welcome change of pace from Aguilera's \"numbing vocal gymnastics\".[226] Matthew Horton from Virgin Media suggested that Aguilera was a more impressive performer than Spears despite her lower sales figures.[224] Aguilera has also been regarded as a sex symbol.[164][227] A 2003 issue of Maxim magazine that she covered became its best-selling issue;[228] Aguilera was named \"Sexiest Woman of the Year\" by its subscribers later that year,[229] and also earned the magazine its best-selling issue after posing on the cover that year.[230] Additionally recognized as a gay icon,[231][232] she was the first honoree on The Abbey's Gay Walk of Fame for her contributions to the LGBT community.[233] The music video for \"Beautiful\" earned Aguilera a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayal of the LGBT community.[234]\nFashion has also been a part of Aguilera's music career and image.[235] She has frequently worn clothes designed by Roberto Cavalli, John Galliano, Marc Jacobs, and Alexander McQueen.[236][237] During the Back to Basics Tour in 2006, Aguilera performed in a stole made of fur designed by Roberto Cavalli, unaware that it was made from real fur of a white fox. After receiving a video about the treatment of foxes from PETA vice president Dan Mathews, Aguilera replaced it with a faux-fur stole, further stating that she was \"very upset\" because she \"only ever wears fake fur\".[238] Aguilera's costumes from Burlesque were featured in the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising's Art of Motion Picture Costume Design exhibition.[239] Wax figures of Aguilera are located at Madame Tussauds wax museums in London and New York City.[240][241]\nAs of 2018, Aguilera had sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide.[242] Aguilera's works have earned her numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards.[243] Various artists have noted that they were inspired by Aguilera, including Ariana Grande,[244] Tinashe,[245] Lady Gaga[246] Sam Smith,[247] and Lauren Jauregui,[248] among others.[249][250][251] Her work has also inspired some athletes, including American figure skater Johnny Weir[252] and American swimmer Dana Vollmer.[253]\nAguilera's use of sexual imagery has helped catalyze public discourse on sexuality and feminism. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, co-founder of The Vagenda, opined that the provocative dance routines in Aguilera's music videos are \"empowering\".[254] Aguilera is also known for her television and music video impact; in 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that Aguilera \"will be remembered for her glamour, her scandalous take on femme-pop and her Brobdingnagian voice, and\u00a0... as the person who almost single-handedly reshaped music-competition reality programming\".[255] She was considered as one of the greatest women of the music video era by VH1.[256]\nWriting for The Hampton Institute, critic Terry Young, Jr. commented that Aguilera \"redefined the 21st century female pop performer,\" adding that following the release of Stripped, \"artists like Spears and Beyonc\u00e9 became more comfortable expressing sexuality and no longer felt the need to sell the notion of innocence\".[257]\nIn November 2008, Rolling Stone placed Aguilera at number 58 on its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, writing that \"[Aguilera] has had the finesse and power of a blues queen ever since she was a child star\".[258] In November 2010, Aguilera was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[259] In October 2012, Aguilera's costumes and video collection was included on the \"Women Who Rock\" exhibition by the National Museum of Women in the Arts.[260] That same year, VH1 named Aguilera the eighth greatest woman in the music industry.[261]\nIn 2013, Gregory Hicks from The Michigan Daily opined that \"Aguilera deserves to be known as one of the greatest artists to ever hit the pop industry.\"[262] At the 2013 People's Choice Awards, Aguilera was awarded the People's Voice Award, which recognized her ability to reach people across various genres.[263] Also in 2013, Aguilera was one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World. In the article for the magazine, Celine Dion wrote, \"Without a doubt, [Aguilera]'s one of the most talented artists the world has ever seen and heard, and I think she's going to continue to amaze us for many, many years to come.\"[264]\nIn 2019, the Human Rights Campaign honored Aguilera with its \"Ally for Equality\" award.

In these political advertisements, shot by David LaChapelle, Aguilera was shown with her mouth sewn shut to symbolize the effects of not voting.[273] In late 2007, Aguilera became the spokesperson for \"Rock the Vote\", through which she encouraged young people to vote in the 2008 presidential election.[274] In 2005, Aguilera donated her wedding gifts to American charities in support of Hurricane Katrina victims,[275] and performed at \"Unite of the Stars\" concert for Unite Against Hunger in Johannesburg, South Africa and for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund at the Coca-Cola Dome.[276]\nIn 2008, Aguilera headlined London's Africa Rising charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which raised awareness for finding substantial issues facing the continent.[277] That year, Aguilera appeared on the Turkish version of Deal or No Deal, Var m\u0131s\u0131n?

                "text": "no title\n\nKeira Christina Knightley, OBE (/\u02c8k\u026a\u0259r\u0259 \u02c8na\u026atli/; born 26 March 1985) is a British actress. She has been nominated for two British Academy Film Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Academy Awards. Knightley began acting on television and made her feature film debut in 1995, before making her breakthrough with the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham. She then starred in the 2003 fantasy swashbuckler film Pirates of the Caribbean, playing Elizabeth Swann, a role that she would reprise in the subsequent films of the franchise. A significant turning point came in her career when Knightley received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for starring as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride & Prejudice (2005). She became known for starring in several other period dramas, including Atonement (2007), The Duchess (2008), A Dangerous Method (2011), Anna Karenina (2012), and Colette (2018). Knightley received her second nomination for the Academy Award for portraying Joan Clarke in the historical drama The Imitation Game (2014). Her contemporary film roles were in the romantic comedy Begin Again (2013), the action thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014), and the adventure film Everest (2015). On stage, Knightley has appeared on the West End in Martin Crimp's 2009 production of The Misanthrope, which earned her a nomination for a Laurence Olivier Award. She also starred as the eponymous heroine in the 2015 Broadway production of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2018 Birthday Honours[1] for services to drama and charity. Keira Christina Knightley was born on 26 March 1985, in Teddington, London, to theatre actors Sharman Macdonald and Will Knightley.[2] Her mother is of Scottish and Welsh descent, while her father is English.[3] She was meant to be named \"Kiera\", the anglicized form of \"Kira\", after Kira Ivanova, whom her father admired. However, Macdonald misspelled the name when she went to register her daughter, writing the \"e\" before the \"i\".[4] Knightley has an elder brother, Caleb.[5] Macdonald also worked as a playwright after her career as an actress came to an end. She introduced her children to theatre and ballet at an early age.[6] This furthered Knightley's interest in acting, and she requested an agent at the age of three.[7] Knightley attended Teddington School.[8] At the age of six, she was diagnosed with dyslexia but by the time she was eleven, with her parents' support, Knightley said, \"they deemed me to have got over it sufficiently\". She is still a slow reader and cannot read out loud.[9] Knightley said she was \"single-minded about acting\".[10] At the age of three, she expressed the desire for an agent like her parents and got one at age six. This led to her taking a number of small parts in TV dramas.[11] While growing up, Knightley performed in a number of local amateur productions, which included After Juliet, written by her mother, and United States, written by her drama teacher. She focused on art, history, and English literature while studying at the Esher College, but left after a year to pursue an acting career.[12] After getting an agent at the age of six, Knightley began working in commercials and small television roles. Her first on-screen appearance was in the 1993 Screen One television episode titled \"Royal Celebration\". She then played Natasha Jordan, a young girl whose mother is involved in an extramarital affair, in the romantic drama A Village Affair (1995). After appearing in a spate of television films through the mid-to-late 1990s, including Innocent Lies (1995), The Treasure Seekers (1996), Coming Home (1998), and Oliver Twist (1999),[13] Knightley landed the role of Sab\u00e9, Padm\u00e9 Amidala's handmaiden and decoy, in the 1999 science fiction blockbuster Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace. Her dialogue was dubbed over by Natalie Portman, who played Padm\u00e9. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even the two actors' mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when they were in full make-up.[14] In her first major role, the 2001 Walt Disney Productions feature film Princess of Thieves, Knightley played the daughter of Robin Hood. To prepare for the film, she trained for several weeks in archery, fencing, and horse riding.[15] Concurrently, she appeared in The Hole, a thriller that received a direct-to-video release in the United States. The film's director Nick Hamm described her as \"a young version of Julie Christie\".[16] Knightley also took on the role of Lara Antipova in the miniseries adaptation of Doctor Zhivago, which first aired in 2002 to positive reviews and high ratings.[17] In the same year, Knightley starred as a pregnant drug addict in Gillies MacKinnon's drama film Pure. Co-starring Molly Parker and Harry Eden, the film had its world premiere at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.[18] In a retrospect review for AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna noted Knightley's screen presence and wrote that \"[although Knightley] doesn't have half of Parker's ability [...] she has spunk and grit [and] shines brightly in Pure\".[19] Despite having appeared in over a dozen film and television roles, Knightley struggled to get a breakthrough.[20] That changed in 2002, when she starred in Gurinder Chadha's sports comedy film Bend It Like Beckham, which was a smash hit both in the UK and in the United States, grossing over $76.6 million.[20] It also surprised film critics who were laudatory of its \"charming\" and \"inspiring\" nature, social context and the cast's performances.[21] Knightley and her co-star Parminder Nagra, who played the central roles of aspiring footballers, attracted international attention for their performances in the film.[22] To prepare for their roles, they underwent three months of extensive football training under the English football coach Simon Clifford. Knightley, who was initially skeptical of the project, went on to win the London Film Critics' Circle for Best Newcomer and the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. In an interview with Tracy Smith she said, \"I remember telling friends I was doing this girls' soccer movie [...] And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good.\"[23] Film critic James Berardinelli, who was largely laudatory of the film and the \"energetic and likable\" cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought \"a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters\".[24] Following the success of Bend It Like Beckham, Knightley landed the role of Elizabeth Swann, in the 2003 American fantasy swashbuckler film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The film, which was based on the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney theme parks, saw Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Johnny Depp play the roles of 18th century pirates.[25] Despite boasting the names of Hollywood stars like Depp and Bloom and a hefty $135 million budget, Pirates was not the most anticipated release of the year, and was expected to fail at the box-office.[26] Knightley herself was not optimistic about its prospects: \"I remember being on set just sort of going, 'OK, what is this? Is this any good?\"[27] However, contrary to the expectations, the film opened at no. 1 on the box-office, and went to become one of the highest grossing productions of the year, with the worldwide collections of $654 million.[28] Knightley appeared in the $247 million grossing British romantic comedy Love Actually, which featured an ensemble cast, including her idol Emma Thompson.[29][30] The film opened in November 2003 to positive critical feedback.[31] Knightley's sole release of 2004 was the historical film King Arthur, where she played Guinevere, a warrior queen and the wife of the titular character.[32] A role that required her to learn boxing, archery, and horse-riding.[30][33] Although the film garnered unfavorable reviews, Knightley's stature as a performer grew; she was voted by the readers of Hello magazine as the industry's most promising teen star,[34] and featured in Time magazine's article, which stated that she seemed dedicated to develop herself as a serious actor rather than a film star.[35] Knightley appeared in three films in 2005, the first of which was the psychological thriller The Jacket, co-starring Adrien Brody.[36] In a mixed review for Empire, Kim Newman wrote that the role was unlike the ones she had previously taken up\u00a0: \"getting out of period gear and talking American, tries to broaden her range and is arguably well-cast\".[37] Knightley next played the titular character in Tony Scott's French-American action film Domino, based on the life of Domino Harvey. The film's release was delayed on multiple occasions, and upon its eventual release in November, it garnered negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office.[38] Knightley's most successful release of the year was Pride & Prejudice, a period drama based on Jane Austen's novel of the same name.[39] Knightley, who admired the book from a young age,[40] said of her character, \"The beauty of Elizabeth is that every woman who ever reads the book seems to recognise herself, with all her faults and imperfections.\"[40] Upon release, the film became a huge commercial success, with total collections of around US$120\u00a0million worldwide, and garnered positive reviews from critics.[41] Derek Elley of Variety wrote highly of her performance and screen presence: \"Looking every bit a star, Knightley, who's shown more spirit than acting smarts so far in her career really steps up to the plate here\". He regarded her \"luminous strength\" to be reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn.[42] Knightley earned Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards for her performance, becoming the third-youngest nominee for the latter.[43] BAFTA's failure to provide her with a nomination drew criticism from the film's producer Tim Bevan.[44] Knightley was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other artists in 2006.[45] Later that year, she reprised her role as Elizabeth Swann in the second and third productions of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The two sequels were conceived in 2004, with the writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. Filming for the projects took place in 2005; the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, released in July 2006. With the worldwide collections of $1.066 billion, it became the biggest financial hit in Knightley's career.[46] The third instalment in the series, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, was released in May, the following year.[47] Knightley's continued association with period dramas yielded varying results, as seen with two of her 2007 releases, Fran\u00e7ois Girard's Silk, and Joe Wright's Atonement, the feature film adaptations of the novels by Alessandro Baricco and Ian McEwan respectively.[48] While the former project failed at the box office, the latter became a critical and commercial success. Knightley garnered widespread acclaim and such accolades as the BAFTA and a nomination for the Golden Globes for her portrayal of Cecilia Tallis, the elder of the two Tallis sisters. In preparing for the film, where she was seen opposite James McAvoy, she studied the \"naturalism\" of the performance as seen in the films from 1930s and 1940s, such as In Which We Serve (1942) and Brief Encounter (1945).[49] Critic Richard Roeper, who thought the lead duo were \"superb\" in their respective roles, was puzzled by their failure to garner Academy Award nominations.[50] Knightley appeared alongside Sienna Miller, Cillian Murphy, and Matthew Rhys in John Maybury's 2008 wartime drama The Edge of Love. The film had her play the role of Vera Phillips, a friend of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin Macnamara. Sharman Macdonald, wrote the screenplay with Knightley (her daughter) as Macnamara in her mind.[51] After Knightley was signed to portray Phillips, the character's role was increased with the film focusing on her romance and marriage with a British soldier.[51] She based her performance on Marlene Dietrich, and was to mime to her prerecorded voice, prior to being told by Maybury to sing live. Knightley initially felt embarrassed while singing live: \"I was shaking like a leaf\", but eventually went through with the plan.[51] Upon release, the film became a moderate critical and commercial success.[52] Knightley's performance and singing abilities were praised by such film critics as Ray Bennett who wrote; \"the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!)\".[53] Knightley then starred as the 18th-century English aristocrat Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire in Saul Dibb's widely praised period drama The Duchess (2008), based on the best-selling biographical novel, Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire by Amanda Foreman.[54] Although multiple media reports suggested that the use of parallels between the central character's life to that of Diana, Princess of Wales was being used as a marketing strategy for the project, Knightley denied any such connection.[55] Gabrielle Tana, the film's producer said the film was repeatedly delayed as they could not find the right actor for the role; she added that with Knightley \"it all happened very, very quickly\". Tana also said Knightley added a \"brought an instinctive understanding\" of such aspects of Georgiana's life as the celebrity issue and being thrust into the spotlight as she had herself experienced the same.[56] Response to her performance was positive; Lidia Look of The Epoch Times praised her range in the film, writing, \"She not only perfectly portrays a witty and feminine Georgiana [...] but also a caring mother, and an abandoned woman.\"[57] The following year, she was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for Best Actress.[58] A film adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy King Lear set to star Knightley and Anthony Hopkins was cancelled due to recession.[59] Knightley made her West End debut with Martin Crimp's version of Moli\u00e8re's comedy The Misanthrope. Starring Knightley, Damian Lewis, Tara Fitzgerald, and Dominic Rowan, the play was staged at London's Comedy Theatre in December 2009. Knightley decided to act in a theatre production as she felt that \"if I don't do theatre right now, I think I'm going to start being too terrified to do it\". While she described it as an \"extraordinary and incredibly fulfilling\" experience, she was sceptical of her performance.[60] Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph described her performance as revealing \"both power and poignancy\" and Paul Taylor of The Independent called it \"not only strikingly convincing, but, at times, rather thrilling in its satiric aplomb\".[61] However, The Guardian's Michael Billington noted that due to the nature of the role, \"one could say that she is not unduly stretched\".[62] In recognition of her theatre debut, Knightley was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and an Evening Standard Award.[63] Knightley appeared in three films in 2010; she said her work during the period helped her \"empathise with people or with situations that I don't necessarily find it easy to empathise with\".[64] Two of the productions, Massy Tadjedin's romantic drama Last Night and William Monahan's crime noir film London Boulevard opened to mixed response from critics and rank among the lowest-grossing films in Knightley's career.[65][66][46] Knightley's other release, Never Let Me Go, an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel of the same name fared better at the box office and received positive reviews. Knightley described the script as unique, one that made the reader think.[64] Co-starring Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan, the film was shot in Norfolk and Clevedon in Somerset.[67] She appeared in a video installation by artist Stuart Pearson Wright titled Maze. Knightley starred in a 2011 revival of The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman at the Comedy Theatre in London.[68] Knightley's only film of 2011 was David Cronenberg's historical drama A Dangerous Method, co-starring Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender, and Vincent Cassel. Based on writer Christopher Hampton's 2002 stage play The Talking Cure and set on the eve of World War I, the film depicts the turbulent relationships between fledgling psychiatrist Carl Jung, his mentor Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein. Knightley portrayed Spielrein, the troubled but beautiful young psychoanalyst who comes between Jung and Freud.[69] The costume film premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival to a positive reception, while Knightley earned generally favourable reviews by critics, with Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com noting her \"the real star of this film\".[70] Knightley co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2012 comedy drama Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.[71] Later that year, she reunited with director Joe Wright to film their third production together, Anna Karenina, in which she starred as the title character.[72] She deemed her collaboration with Wright as the most important of her career.[73] Knightley garnered positive reviews for her performance, prompting early Oscar buzz.[74] The 2013 Toronto International Film Festival saw the release of Knightley's first musical film Begin Again with Mark Ruffalo. The film, which was directed by John Carney, had its theatrical release in 2014. Carney later repeatedly criticised Knightley's performance in the film; saying she was not convincing enough in portraying a singer-songwriter and continuously describing her as a \"model\" rather than an actor.[75] He later apologised to her on Twitter for his comments.[76] Knightley revealed in July that music doesn't \"sink in\" for her, and she is more interested in books and drama.[77] Later that year, she appeared in Karl Lagerfeld's short period film Once Upon a Time\u00a0...[78] 2014, for Knightley, began with the spy thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit alongside Chris Pine. It was based on novelist Tom Clancy's fictional character Jack Ryan and was the fifth film in the Jack Ryan film series.[79] The film received mixed critical reviews nonetheless strong box-office response.[80] Knightley's next film Laggies (2014), premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival prior to its US general-release on 24 October.[81] A romantic comedy also starring Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Sam Rockwell, the film follows the life of Megan (played by Knightley), a underachiever going through a quarter-life crisis. Laggies opened to mostly positive reviews from critics, with Knightley's performance being chiefly praised by critics.[82] Inkoo Kaang of TheWrap wrote of her \"delightfully uncouth\" performance: \"She's a loose-limbed revelation as a pretty-but-normal-looking woman who just can't take things seriously enough to pull her life together.\"[83] It was followed by her appearance in Morten Tyldum's historical drama The Imitation Game, a film based on the British mathematician Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). Knightley portrayed cryptanalyst and numismatist Joan Clarke, who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during World War II with Turing.[84] The Imitation Game became a critical and commercial success grossing over $233.6 million.[85] For her performance, Knightley received her second Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress.[84] Though Lady Jean Forde, who worked with Clarke and Turing at that time felt Knightley was \"too beautiful\" to play Clarke and said: \"She [Clarke] was nothing like Keira\".[86] Knightley's sole release of 2015 was as part of the ensemble cast in the biographical disaster film Everest. The film was based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster with Knightley portraying mountaineer Rob Hall's wife.[87] Everest opened to mixed review from critics.[88] In October 2015, Knightley made her Broadway debut playing the title role in Helen Edmundson's adaptation of \u00c9mile Zola's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin at Studio 54.[89] Her performance received positive reviews. Alexandra Villarreal of The Huffington Post wrote: \"She fumes, and rages, and withdraws, and you can watch her psychological evolution from stifled wife to impassioned mistress to haunted murderer\".[90] Knightley then starred in the ensemble drama Collateral Beauty (2016), alongside Will Smith, Edward Norton, Helen Mirren, and Kate Winslet.[91] The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews,[92][93] and earned the cast a Razzie nomination.[94] Despite previously stating on a number of occasions that she would never return to the Pirates of the Caribbean film series,[95] Knightley reprised her role of Elizabeth Swann with a cameo appearance in 2017's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.[96] In 2018, Colette premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In an interview with Variety to promote the film, Knightley criticized the way female characters are portrayed in films set in the modern day stating: \"I don't really do films set in the modern day because the female characters nearly always get raped. I always find something distasteful in the way women are portrayed, whereas I've always found very inspiring characters offered to me in historical pieces\".[97] Knightley was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.[98] The same year, she played the Sugar Plum Fairy in Disney's adaptation of The Nutcracker, titled The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and Joe Johnston.[99] The film received generally negative reviews.[100][101][102] In 2019, Knightley co-starred in The Aftermath, a film adaption of the novel by Rhidian Brook, alongside Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd.[103][104] While promoting it, Knightley said she chose to no longer appear nude in film after having a child.[105] The film received mixed reviews,[104] and Knightley received a mixed response as well.[106][107] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr praised Knightley for adding \"conviction, grace, heart, and nerve\" to the movie,[106] while the Los Angeles Times' Katie Walsh felt Knightley and Skarsg\u00e5rd were too reserved.[107] Knightley plays Katharine Gun in Official Secrets,[108] which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 28 January 2019 to good reviews.[109] She is set to portray feminist activist Sally Alexander for the film Misbehaviour about the crowning of the first black Miss World contestant at the 1970 Miss World competition.[110][111] She has also committed to a comedy about an extended family who come together for a Christmas dinner.[112] Knightley took a break from working in 2006,[113] suggesting that she wanted to take some time off acting to travel and focus on her personal life.[114] Speaking to the press in July 2014, she explained that it felt like she had reached the end of the first stage of her career, and the 2014 film Begin Again was like \"it's beginning again\".[77] Knightley identifies as an atheist.[115] In 2007, Knightley sued the Daily Mail for publishing an article that speculated as to whether she suffered from anorexia nervosa or some other eating disorder.[116] Knightley won the lawsuit, and was awarded \u00a33,000 in damages. She added to this amount and donated a total of \u00a36,000 to Beat, a charity for those who suffer mental illness and eating disorders.[117] A man was charged with harassment in February 2010 after trying to contact Knightley on several occasions outside the Comedy Theatre in London, where she appeared in the play The Misanthrope.[118] The subsequent trial folded after she was unavailable to testify in court.[119] Another man was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after harassing Knightley outside her home and stalking her in December 2016.[120] Knightley began dating actor Del Synnott in 2001, having met him during the filming of Princess of Thieves; they split up in 2003. Knightley then dated model and actor Jamie Dornan from 2003 to 2005.[121] She was in a relationship with her Pride & Prejudice co-star Rupert Friend from 2005 until December 2010.[122] Knightley has been in a relationship with musician James Righton, of Klaxons, since February 2011.[123] They were married on 4 May 2013, in Mazan, Vaucluse.[124] The couple have two daughters, Edie, born in May 2015,[125] and Delilah, born in September 2019.[126] Knightley advocates equal paternity leave and has spoken about the expense of childcare in England. She said in an interview for the December 2016 issue of Harper's Bazaar that she had been \"lucky to be able to afford really good childcare, because otherwise it would be at least four years out of my career\".[127][128] In October 2018, Keira Knightley revealed, while speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, she had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder as she struggled to adjust to her sudden rise to fame. Knightley described how at one point she did not leave the house for three months. In 2008, Knightley had to have hypnotherapy to prevent panic attacks in order to be able to attend that year's BAFTAS.[129] Knightley is the face of an Amnesty International campaign to support human rights, marking the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[130] In 2004, she travelled to Ethiopia alongside Richard Curtis, Sanjeev Bhaskar and Julian Metcalfe on behalf of the Comic Relief charity.[131] She posed for photos for WaterAid in 2005 and also for the American Library Association's \"Read\" campaign (a promotional poster of Pride & Prejudice).[132] The dress she wore to the 2006 Academy Awards was donated to the charity Oxfam, where it raised \u00a34,300.[133] In April 2009, Knightley appeared in a video to raise awareness of domestic abuse entitled Cut shot for Women's Aid.[134] The video created controversy, with some sources calling it too graphic, while other groups support the video for showing a realistic depiction of domestic violence.[135] In November 2010, Knightley became patron of the SMA Trust, a British charity that funds medical research into the disease spinal muscular atrophy.[136] For International Women's Day 2014, Knightley was one of the artist signatories of Amnesty International's letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, in which the organisation campaigned for women's rights in Afghanistan.[137] In July 2014 Knightley travelled to South Sudan on behalf of Oxfam to meet refugees of the South Sudanese Civil War and raise awareness of the conflict.[138] In May 2016, Knightley signed a letter imploring Britain to vote \"remain\" in the forthcoming UK EU Referendum. The letter was also signed by John le Carr\u00e9, Benedict Cumberbatch and Danny Boyle among others.[139] Later, she appeared in a video aimed at encouraging younger people to vote in the Referendum.[140] On 12 September 2016, Knightley, as well as Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Peter Capaldi, Douglas Booth, Neil Gaiman, Jesse Eisenberg, Juliet Stevenson, Kit Harington, and Stanley Tucci, featured in a video from the United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR to help raise awareness to the global refugee crisis. The video, titled \"What They Took With Them\", has the actors reading a poem, written by Jenifer Toksvig and inspired by primary accounts of refugees, and is part of UNHCR's #WithRefugees campaign, of which also includes a petition to governments to expand asylum to provide further shelter, integrating job opportunities, and education.[141] In September 2016, Knightley co-hosted A Night to Remember, part of the Green Carpet Challenge, a charity event highlighting sustainability within the fashion industry.[142] In September 2017, Knightley traded stocks on behalf of the spinal muscular atrophy charity SMA Trust as part of the BGC Charity Day which was set up to commemorate the stockbrokers who were killed during the September 11 attacks.[143] Knightley has been described by media outlets as \"famously open with media\",[144] although she herself has stated the contrary: \"I don't talk about my private life.\"[145] In a 2004 BBC poll, Knightley was named among the most influential people in British culture.[146] Knightley has been listed as one of the 100 Sexiest Women in the World by FHM on multiple occasions. She made her first appearance on the list in 2004, and was named \"the sexiest woman in the world\" in 2006.[147] She was included in every subsequent issue up until 2009.[148] She was a part of the American editions of the list from 2004 to 2006, and was also placed ninth on Maxim's Hot 100 list in 2006.[149] Knightley received media attention for her perspectives on feminism, voiced in an interview for Harper's Bazaar UK published in the February 2014 edition. Knightley explained that female artists face greater hurdles in the film industry compared to their male counterparts, and also revealed that she was perplexed by the use of \"feminist\" in a derogatory sense: \"Somehow, it [feminism] became a dirty word. I thought it was really weird for a long time, and I think it's great that we're coming out of that.\"[150] Knightley posed topless for the September 2014 issue of Interview, on the condition that she not be photoshopped, to draw attention to how \"women's bodies are a battleground, and photography is partly to blame\".[151] Knightley was the celebrity face for the luxury goods brands Asprey and Shiatzy Chen as well as Lux haircare products in Japanese television commercials.[152] In April 2006, she was confirmed as the new celebrity face of Chanel's perfume Coco Mademoiselle, though the first photo from the campaign was not released until May 2007.[153] Knightley has appeared in television commercials for Chanel directed by Joe Wright since 2007, and has endorsed Chanel Fine Jewellery's collection Coco Crush.[154] Knightley has been nominated twice for an Academy Award: in 2005 for Best Actress for Pride & Prejudice; and in 2015 for Best Supporting Actress for The Imitation Game.",

She has been nominated for two British Academy Film Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Academy Awards.\nKnightley began acting on television and made her feature film debut in 1995, before making her breakthrough with the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham. She then starred in the 2003 fantasy swashbuckler film Pirates of the Caribbean, playing Elizabeth Swann, a role that she would reprise in the subsequent films of the franchise. A significant turning point came in her career when Knightley received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for starring as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005). She became known for starring in several other period dramas, including Atonement (2007), The Duchess (2008), A Dangerous Method (2011), Anna Karenina (2012), and Colette (2018). Knightley received her second nomination for the Academy Award for portraying Joan Clarke in the historical drama The Imitation Game (2014). Her contemporary film roles were in the romantic comedy Begin Again (2013), the action thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014), and the adventure film Everest (2015).\nOn stage, Knightley has appeared on the West End in Martin Crimp's 2009 production of The Misanthrope, which earned her a nomination for a Laurence Olivier Award. She also starred as the eponymous heroine in the 2015 Broadway production of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2018 Birthday Honours[1] for services to drama and charity.\nKeira Christina Knightley was born on 26 March 1985, in Teddington, London, to theatre actors Sharman Macdonald and Will Knightley.[2] Her mother is of Scottish and Welsh descent, while her father is English.[3] She was meant to be named \"Kiera\", the anglicized form of \"Kira\", after Kira Ivanova, whom her father admired. However, Macdonald misspelled the name when she went to register her daughter, writing the \"e\" before the \"i\".[4] Knightley has an elder brother, Caleb.[5] Macdonald also worked as a playwright after her career as an actress came to an end. She introduced her children to theatre and ballet at an early age.[6] This furthered Knightley's interest in acting, and she requested an agent at the age of three.[7]\nKnightley attended Teddington School.[8] At the age of six, she was diagnosed with dyslexia but by the time she was eleven, with her parents' support, Knightley said, \"they deemed me to have got over it sufficiently\". She is still a slow reader and cannot read out loud.[9] Knightley said she was \"single-minded about acting\".[10] At the age of three, she expressed the desire for an agent like her parents and got one at age six. This led to her taking a number of small parts in TV dramas.[11] While growing up, Knightley performed in a number of local amateur productions, which included After Juliet, written by her mother, and United States, written by her drama teacher. She focused on art, history, and English literature while studying at the Esher College, but left after a year to pursue an acting career.[12]\nAfter getting an agent at the age of six, Knightley began working in commercials and small television roles. Her first on-screen appearance was in the 1993 Screen One television episode titled \"Royal Celebration\". She then played Natasha Jordan, a young girl whose mother is involved in an extramarital affair, in the romantic drama A Village Affair (1995). After appearing in a spate of television films through the mid-to-late 1990s, including Innocent Lies (1995), The Treasure Seekers (1996), Coming Home (1998), and Oliver Twist (1999),[13] Knightley landed the role of Sab\u00e9, Padm\u00e9 Amidala's handmaiden and decoy, in the 1999 science fiction blockbuster Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace. Her dialogue was dubbed over by Natalie Portman, who played Padm\u00e9. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even the two actors' mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when they were in full make-up.[14]\nIn her first major role, the 2001 Walt Disney Productions feature film Princess of Thieves, Knightley played the daughter of Robin Hood. To prepare for the film, she trained for several weeks in archery, fencing, and horse riding.[15] Concurrently, she appeared in The Hole, a thriller that received a direct-to-video release in the United States. The film's director Nick Hamm described her as \"a young version of Julie Christie\".[16] Knightley also took on the role of Lara Antipova in the miniseries adaptation of Doctor Zhivago, which first aired in 2002 to positive reviews and high ratings.[17] In the same year, Knightley starred as a pregnant drug addict in Gillies MacKinnon's drama film Pure. Co-starring Molly Parker and Harry Eden, the film had its world premiere at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.[18] In a retrospect review for AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna noted Knightley's screen presence and wrote that \"[although Knightley] doesn't have half of Parker's ability [...] she has spunk and grit [and] shines brightly in Pure\".[19]\nDespite having appeared in over a dozen film and television roles, Knightley struggled to get a breakthrough.[20] That changed in 2002, when she starred in Gurinder Chadha's sports comedy film Bend It Like Beckham, which was a smash hit both in the UK and in the United States, grossing over $76.6 million.[20] It also surprised film critics who were laudatory of its \"charming\" and \"inspiring\" nature, social context and the cast's performances.[21] Knightley and her co-star Parminder Nagra, who played the central roles of aspiring footballers, attracted international attention for their performances in the film.[22] To prepare for their roles, they underwent three months of extensive football training under the English football coach Simon Clifford. Knightley, who was initially skeptical of the project, went on to win the London Film Critics' Circle for Best Newcomer and the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. In an interview with Tracy Smith she said, \"I remember telling friends I was doing this girls' soccer movie [...] And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good.\"[23] Film critic James Berardinelli, who was largely laudatory of the film and the \"energetic and likable\" cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought \"a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters\".[24]\nFollowing the success of Bend It Like Beckham, Knightley landed the role of Elizabeth Swann, in the 2003 American fantasy swashbuckler film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The film, which was based on the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney theme parks, saw Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Johnny Depp play the roles of 18th century pirates.[25] Despite boasting the names of Hollywood stars like Depp and Bloom and a hefty $135 million budget, Pirates was not the most anticipated release of the year, and was expected to fail at the box-office.[26] Knightley herself was not optimistic about its prospects: \"I remember being on set just sort of going, 'OK, what is this? Is this any good?\"[27] However, contrary to the expectations, the film opened at no. 1 on the box-office, and went to become one of the highest grossing productions of the year, with the worldwide collections of $654 million.[28]\nKnightley appeared in the $247 million grossing British romantic comedy Love Actually, which featured an ensemble cast, including her idol Emma Thompson.[29][30] The film opened in November 2003 to positive critical feedback.[31] Knightley's sole release of 2004 was the historical film King Arthur, where she played Guinevere, a warrior queen and the wife of the titular character.[32] A role that required her to learn boxing, archery, and horse-riding.[30][33] Although the film garnered unfavorable reviews, Knightley's stature as a performer grew; she was voted by the readers of Hello magazine as the industry's most promising teen star,[34] and featured in Time magazine's article, which stated that she seemed dedicated to develop herself as a serious actor rather than a film star.[35]\nKnightley appeared in three films in 2005, the first of which was the psychological thriller The Jacket, co-starring Adrien Brody.[36] In a mixed review for Empire, Kim Newman wrote that the role was unlike the ones she had previously taken up\u00a0: \"getting out of period gear and talking American, tries to broaden her range and is arguably well-cast\".[37] Knightley next played the titular character in Tony Scott's French-American action film Domino, based on the life of Domino Harvey. The film's release was delayed on multiple occasions, and upon its eventual release in November, it garnered negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office.[38]\nKnightley's most successful release of the year was Pride &amp; Prejudice, a period drama based on Jane Austen's novel of the same name.[39] Knightley, who admired the book from a young age,[40] said of her character, \"The beauty of Elizabeth is that every woman who ever reads the book seems to recognise herself, with all her faults and imperfections.\"[40] Upon release, the film became a huge commercial success, with total collections of around US$120\u00a0million worldwide, and garnered positive reviews from critics.[41] Derek Elley of Variety wrote highly of her performance and screen presence: \"Looking every bit a star, Knightley, who's shown more spirit than acting smarts so far in her career really steps up to the plate here\". He regarded her \"luminous strength\" to be reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn.[42] Knightley earned Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards for her performance, becoming the third-youngest nominee for the latter.[43] BAFTA's failure to provide her with a nomination drew criticism from the film's producer Tim Bevan.[44]\nKnightley was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other artists in 2006.[45] Later that year, she reprised her role as Elizabeth Swann in the second and third productions of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The two sequels were conceived in 2004, with the writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. Filming for the projects took place in 2005; the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, released in July 2006. With the worldwide collections of $1.066 billion, it became the biggest financial hit in Knightley's career.[46] The third instalment in the series, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, was released in May, the following year.[47]\nKnightley's continued association with period dramas yielded varying results, as seen with two of her 2007 releases, Fran\u00e7ois Girard's Silk, and Joe Wright's Atonement, the feature film adaptations of the novels by Alessandro Baricco and Ian McEwan respectively.[48] While the former project failed at the box office, the latter became a critical and commercial success. Knightley garnered widespread acclaim and such accolades as the BAFTA and a nomination for the Golden Globes for her portrayal of Cecilia Tallis, the elder of the two Tallis sisters. In preparing for the film, where she was seen opposite James McAvoy, she studied the \"naturalism\" of the performance as seen in the films from 1930s and 1940s, such as In Which We Serve (1942) and Brief Encounter (1945).[49] Critic Richard Roeper, who thought the lead duo were \"superb\" in their respective roles, was puzzled by their failure to garner Academy Award nominations.[50]\nKnightley appeared alongside Sienna Miller, Cillian Murphy, and Matthew Rhys in John Maybury's 2008 wartime drama The Edge of Love. The film had her play the role of Vera Phillips, a friend of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin Macnamara. Sharman Macdonald, wrote the screenplay with Knightley (her daughter) as Macnamara in her mind.[51] After Knightley was signed to portray Phillips, the character's role was increased with the film focusing on her romance and marriage with a British soldier.[51] She based her performance on Marlene Dietrich, and was to mime to her prerecorded voice, prior to being told by Maybury to sing live. Knightley initially felt embarrassed while singing live: \"I was shaking like a leaf\", but eventually went through with the plan.[51] Upon release, the film became a moderate critical and commercial success.[52] Knightley's performance and singing abilities were praised by such film critics as Ray Bennett who wrote; \"the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!)\".[53]\nKnightley then starred as the 18th-century English aristocrat Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire in Saul Dibb's widely praised period drama The Duchess (2008), based on the best-selling biographical novel, Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire by Amanda Foreman.[54] Although multiple media reports suggested that the use of parallels between the central character's life to that of Diana, Princess of Wales was being used as a marketing strategy for the project, Knightley denied any such connection.[55] Gabrielle Tana, the film's producer said the film was repeatedly delayed as they could not find the right actor for the role; she added that with Knightley \"it all happened very, very quickly\". Tana also said Knightley added a \"brought an instinctive understanding\" of such aspects of Georgiana's life as the celebrity issue and being thrust into the spotlight as she had herself experienced the same.[56] Response to her performance was positive; Lidia Look of The Epoch Times praised her range in the film, writing, \"She not only perfectly portrays a witty and feminine Georgiana [...] but also a caring mother, and an abandoned woman.\"[57] The following year, she was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for Best Actress.[58] A film adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy King Lear set to star Knightley and Anthony Hopkins was cancelled due to recession.[59]\nKnightley made her West End debut with Martin Crimp's version of Moli\u00e8re's comedy The Misanthrope. Starring Knightley, Damian Lewis, Tara Fitzgerald, and Dominic Rowan, the play was staged at London's Comedy Theatre in December 2009. Knightley decided to act in a theatre production as she felt that \"if I don't do theatre right now, I think I'm going to start being too terrified to do it\". While she described it as an \"extraordinary and incredibly fulfilling\" experience, she was sceptical of her performance.[60] Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph described her performance as revealing \"both power and poignancy\" and Paul Taylor of The Independent called it \"not only strikingly convincing, but, at times, rather thrilling in its satiric aplomb\".[61] However, The Guardian's Michael Billington noted that due to the nature of the role, \"one could say that she is not unduly stretched\".[62] In recognition of her theatre debut, Knightley was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and an Evening Standard Award.[63]\nKnightley appeared in three films in 2010; she said her work during the period helped her \"empathise with people or with situations that I don't necessarily find it easy to empathise with\".[64] Two of the productions, Massy Tadjedin's romantic drama Last Night and William Monahan's crime noir film London Boulevard opened to mixed response from critics and rank among the lowest-grossing films in Knightley's career.[65][66][46] Knightley's other release, Never Let Me Go, an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel of the same name fared better at the box office and received positive reviews. Knightley described the script as unique, one that made the reader think.[64] Co-starring Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan, the film was shot in Norfolk and Clevedon in Somerset.[67] She appeared in a video installation by artist Stuart Pearson Wright titled Maze.\nKnightley starred in a 2011 revival of The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman at the Comedy Theatre in London.[68] Knightley's only film of 2011 was David Cronenberg's historical drama A Dangerous Method, co-starring Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender, and Vincent Cassel. Based on writer Christopher Hampton's 2002 stage play The Talking Cure and set on the eve of World War I, the film depicts the turbulent relationships between fledgling psychiatrist Carl Jung, his mentor Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein. Knightley portrayed Spielrein, the troubled but beautiful young psychoanalyst who comes between Jung and Freud.[69] The costume film premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival to a positive reception, while Knightley earned generally favourable reviews by critics, with Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com noting her \"the real star of this film\".[70]\nKnightley co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2012 comedy drama Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.[71] Later that year, she reunited with director Joe Wright to film their third production together, Anna Karenina, in which she starred as the title character.[72] She deemed her collaboration with Wright as the most important of her career.[73] Knightley garnered positive reviews for her performance, prompting early Oscar buzz.[74] The 2013 Toronto International Film Festival saw the release of Knightley's first musical film Begin Again with Mark Ruffalo. The film, which was directed by John Carney, had its theatrical release in 2014. Carney later repeatedly criticised Knightley's performance in the film; saying she was not convincing enough in portraying a singer-songwriter and continuously describing her as a \"model\" rather than an actor.[75] He later apologised to her on Twitter for his comments.[76] Knightley revealed in July that music doesn't \"sink in\" for her, and she is more interested in books and drama.[77] Later that year, she appeared in Karl Lagerfeld's short period film Once Upon a Time\u00a0...[78]\n2014, for Knightley, began with the spy thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit alongside Chris Pine. It was based on novelist Tom Clancy's fictional character Jack Ryan and was the fifth film in the Jack Ryan film series.[79] The film received mixed critical reviews nonetheless strong box-office response.[80] Knightley's next film Laggies (2014), premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival prior to its US general-release on 24 October.[81] A romantic comedy also starring Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Sam Rockwell, the film follows the life of Megan (played by Knightley), a underachiever going through a quarter-life crisis. Laggies opened to mostly positive reviews from critics, with Knightley's performance being chiefly praised by critics.[82] Inkoo Kaang of TheWrap wrote of her \"delightfully uncouth\" performance: \"She's a loose-limbed revelation as a pretty-but-normal-looking woman who just can't take things seriously enough to pull her life together.\"[83]\nIt was followed by her appearance in Morten Tyldum's historical drama The Imitation Game, a film based on the British mathematician Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). Knightley portrayed cryptanalyst and numismatist Joan Clarke, who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during World War II with Turing.[84] The Imitation Game became a critical and commercial success grossing over $233.6 million.[85] For her performance, Knightley received her second Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress.[84] Though Lady Jean Forde, who worked with Clarke and Turing at that time felt Knightley was \"too beautiful\" to play Clarke and said: \"She [Clarke] was nothing like Keira\".[86]\nKnightley's sole release of 2015 was as part of the ensemble cast in the biographical disaster film Everest. The film was based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster with Knightley portraying mountaineer Rob Hall's wife.[87] Everest opened to mixed review from critics.[88] In October 2015, Knightley made her Broadway debut playing the title role in Helen Edmundson's adaptation of \u00c9mile Zola's Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin at Studio 54.[89] Her performance received positive reviews. Alexandra Villarreal of The Huffington Post wrote: \"She fumes, and rages, and withdraws, and you can watch her psychological evolution from stifled wife to impassioned mistress to haunted murderer\".[90] Knightley then starred in the ensemble drama Collateral Beauty (2016), alongside Will Smith, Edward Norton, Helen Mirren, and Kate Winslet.[91] The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews,[92][93] and earned the cast a Razzie nomination.[94] Despite previously stating on a number of occasions that she would never return to the Pirates of the Caribbean film series,[95] Knightley reprised her role of Elizabeth Swann with a cameo appearance in 2017's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.[96]\nIn 2018, Colette premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In an interview with Variety to promote the film, Knightley criticized the way female characters are portrayed in films set in the modern day stating: \"I don't really do films set in the modern day because the female characters nearly always get raped. I always find something distasteful in the way women are portrayed, whereas I've always found very inspiring characters offered to me in historical pieces\".[97] Knightley was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.[98] The same year, she played the Sugar Plum Fairy in Disney's adaptation of The Nutcracker, titled The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and Joe Johnston.[99] The film received generally negative reviews.[100][101][102]\nIn 2019, Knightley co-starred in The Aftermath, a film adaption of the novel by Rhidian Brook, alongside Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd.[103][104] While promoting it, Knightley said she chose to no longer appear nude in film after having a child.[105] The film received mixed reviews,[104] and Knightley received a mixed response as well.[106][107] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr praised Knightley for adding \"conviction, grace, heart, and nerve\" to the movie,[106] while the Los Angeles Times' Katie Walsh felt Knightley and Skarsg\u00e5rd were too reserved.[107] Knightley plays Katharine Gun in Official Secrets,[108] which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 28 January 2019 to good reviews.[109] She is set to portray feminist activist Sally Alexander for the film Misbehaviour about the crowning of the first black Miss World contestant at the 1970 Miss World competition.[110][111] She has also committed to a comedy about an extended family who come together for a Christmas dinner.[112]\nKnightley took a break from working in 2006,[113] suggesting that she wanted to take some time off acting to travel and focus on her personal life.[114] Speaking to the press in July 2014, she explained that it felt like she had reached the end of the first stage of her career, and the 2014 film Begin Again was like \"it's beginning again\".[77] Knightley identifies as an atheist.[115]\nIn 2007, Knightley sued the Daily Mail for publishing an article that speculated as to whether she suffered from anorexia nervosa or some other eating disorder.[116] Knightley won the lawsuit, and was awarded \u00a33,000 in damages. She added to this amount and donated a total of \u00a36,000 to Beat, a charity for those who suffer mental illness and eating disorders.[117]\nA man was charged with harassment in February 2010 after trying to contact Knightley on several occasions outside the Comedy Theatre in London, where she appeared in the play The Misanthrope.[118] The subsequent trial folded after she was unavailable to testify in court.[119] Another man was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after harassing Knightley outside her home and stalking her in December 2016.[120]\nKnightley began dating actor Del Synnott in 2001, having met him during the filming of Princess of Thieves; they split up in 2003. Knightley then dated model and actor Jamie Dornan from 2003 to 2005.[121] She was in a relationship with her Pride &amp; Prejudice co-star Rupert Friend from 2005 until December 2010.[122]\nKnightley has been in a relationship with musician James Righton, of Klaxons, since February 2011.[123] They were married on 4 May 2013, in Mazan, Vaucluse.[124] The couple have two daughters, Edie, born in May 2015,[125] and Delilah, born in September 2019.[126] Knightley advocates equal paternity leave and has spoken about the expense of childcare in England. She said in an interview for the December 2016 issue of Harper's Bazaar that she had been \"lucky to be able to afford really good childcare, because otherwise it would be at least four years out of my career\".[127][128]\nIn October 2018, Keira Knightley revealed, while speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, she had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder as she struggled to adjust to her sudden rise to fame. Knightley described how at one point she did not leave the house for three months. In 2008, Knightley had to have hypnotherapy to prevent panic attacks in order to be able to attend that year's BAFTAS.[129]\nKnightley is the face of an Amnesty International campaign to support human rights, marking the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[130] In 2004, she travelled to Ethiopia alongside Richard Curtis, Sanjeev Bhaskar and Julian Metcalfe on behalf of the Comic Relief charity.[131] She posed for photos for WaterAid in 2005 and also for the American Library Association's \"Read\" campaign (a promotional poster of Pride &amp; Prejudice).[132] The dress she wore to the 2006 Academy Awards was donated to the charity Oxfam, where it raised \u00a34,300.[133]\nIn April 2009, Knightley appeared in a video to raise awareness of domestic abuse entitled Cut shot for Women's Aid.[134] The video created controversy, with some sources calling it too graphic, while other groups support the video for showing a realistic depiction of domestic violence.[135] In November 2010, Knightley became patron of the SMA Trust, a British charity that funds medical research into the disease spinal muscular atrophy.[136]\nFor International Women's Day 2014, Knightley was one of the artist signatories of Amnesty International's letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, in which the organisation campaigned for women's rights in Afghanistan.[137] In July 2014 Knightley travelled to South Sudan on behalf of Oxfam to meet refugees of the South Sudanese Civil War and raise awareness of the conflict.[138]\nIn May 2016, Knightley signed a letter imploring Britain to vote \"remain\" in the forthcoming UK EU Referendum. The letter was also signed by John le Carr\u00e9, Benedict Cumberbatch and Danny Boyle among others.[139] Later, she appeared in a video aimed at encouraging younger people to vote in the Referendum.[140]\nOn 12 September 2016, Knightley, as well as Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Peter Capaldi, Douglas Booth, Neil Gaiman, Jesse Eisenberg, Juliet Stevenson, Kit Harington, and Stanley Tucci, featured in a video from the United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR to help raise awareness to the global refugee crisis. The video, titled \"What They Took With Them\", has the actors reading a poem, written by Jenifer Toksvig and inspired by primary accounts of refugees, and is part of UNHCR's #WithRefugees campaign, of which also includes a petition to governments to expand asylum to provide further shelter, integrating job opportunities, and education.[141]\nIn September 2016, Knightley co-hosted A Night to Remember, part of the Green Carpet Challenge, a charity event highlighting sustainability within the fashion industry.[142] In September 2017, Knightley traded stocks on behalf of the spinal muscular atrophy charity SMA Trust as part of the BGC Charity Day which was set up to commemorate the stockbrokers who were killed during the September 11 attacks.[143]\nKnightley has been described by media outlets as \"famously open with media\",[144] although she herself has stated the contrary: \"I don't talk about my private life.\"[145] In a 2004 BBC poll, Knightley was named among the most influential people in British culture.[146] Knightley has been listed as one of the 100 Sexiest Women in the World by FHM on multiple occasions. She made her first appearance on the list in 2004, and was named \"the sexiest woman in the world\" in 2006.[147] She was included in every subsequent issue up until 2009.[148] She was a part of the American editions of the list from 2004 to 2006, and was also placed ninth on Maxim's Hot 100 list in 2006.[149]\nKnightley received media attention for her perspectives on feminism, voiced in an interview for Harper's Bazaar UK published in the\nFebruary 2014 edition. Knightley explained that female artists face greater hurdles in the film industry compared to their male counterparts, and also revealed that she was perplexed by the use of \"feminist\" in a derogatory sense: \"Somehow, it [feminism] became a dirty word.

In 2018, Schumer married chef Chris Fischer; the couple's son was born in 2019. Schumer was born on June 1, 1981 on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York,[1][2] to Sandra Jane (n\u00e9e Jones) and Gordon David Schumer, who owned a baby-furniture company.[2][3][4] She later moved with her mother to Long Island, where she attended South Side High School in Rockville Centre, New York.[5][6] She has a younger sister, Kim Caramele, who is a comedy writer and a producer,[7][8] and a half-brother, Jason Stein,[9] who is a musician in Chicago, Illinois.[10][11] Schumer's father was born to a Jewish family from Ukraine.[12][13] He is a second cousin of U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer.[14][15][16] Her mother, who is from a Protestant background and deep New England roots, converted to Judaism before her marriage.[4][17][18] Schumer was raised Jewish and says she had to deal with antisemitism as a child.[19][20][21] Her mother's ancestry included Puritans in the 17th-century English colony of Massachusetts. As a guest on Finding Your Roots in 2017, Schumer learned that in 1704, three children from her ancestor Thomas Tarbell's family were captured at Groton, Massachusetts in a French-Abenaki raid and taken to Montreal. The girl was ransomed by a French-Canadian family and ultimately joined a French Catholic convent; the two boys were each adopted by Mohawk families at Kahnawake and became thoroughly assimilated.[6] Through the success of her father's furniture company in Manhattan, Schumer's household was wealthy during her early years.[22] When she was nine years old, her father's business failed and he went bankrupt, and either then[14] or when she was 12[23] (sources differ), her father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Some time afterward, her parents divorced.[14] Moving to Long Island with her mother, Schumer lived in Rockville Centre, New York and attended South Side High School.

I had a great time because there was no pressure on me; I had been doing stand-up around two years. I wasn't supposed to do well. So every time I advanced it was a happy surprise. I kept it honest on the show and it served me well.\"[30] Schumer co-starred in the Comedy Central reality show Reality Bites Back in 2008.[31] In 2009, she appeared in an advertising campaign for Butterfinger.[32] Schumer was a recurring guest on Fox News late-night program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld between 2007 and 2012.

Schumer released a standup comedy album, Cutting, in 2011.[36] Her standup comedy special Mostly Sex Stuff premiered on Comedy Central on August 18, 2012, to positive reviews.[37] Schumer said in February 2012, \"I don't like the observational stuff. I like tackling the stuff nobody else talks about, like the darkest, most serious thing about yourself. I talk about life and sex and personal stories and stuff everybody can relate to, and some can't.\"[38] In June 2012, Schumer began work on a sketch comedy series for Comedy Central. The show included single-camera vignettes of Schumer playing \"heightened versions\" of herself.

That includes making dumb jokes involving race... You can call it a 'blind spot for racism' or 'lazy,' but you are wrong. It is a joke ... I am not racist.\"[70] Throughout 2015, several of Schumer's skits in Inside Amy Schumer went viral online, sparking think pieces regarding sex, feminism, and rape culture.[71][72][73][74] After a fatal shooting took place at a showing of Trainwreck in Louisiana, Schumer advocated for stricter gun control laws and increased mental health funding.[75] In November 2015, Schumer posed nude for a photo by photographer Annie Leibovitz for 2016 edition of the Pirelli Calendar.[76] Schumer tweeted the photo, writing \"Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman.

As a guest on Finding Your Roots in 2017, Schumer learned that in 1704, three children from her ancestor Thomas Tarbell's family were captured at Groton, Massachusetts in a French-Abenaki raid and taken to Montreal. The girl was ransomed by a French-Canadian family and ultimately joined a French Catholic convent; the two boys were each adopted by Mohawk families at Kahnawake and became thoroughly assimilated.[6]\nThrough the success of her father's furniture company in Manhattan, Schumer's household was wealthy during her early years.[22] When she was nine years old, her father's business failed and he went bankrupt, and either then[14] or when she was 12[23] (sources differ), her father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Some time afterward, her parents divorced.[14] Moving to Long Island with her mother, Schumer lived in Rockville Centre, New York and attended South Side High School.

I had a great time because there was no pressure on me; I had been doing stand-up around two years. I wasn't supposed to do well. So every time I advanced it was a happy surprise. I kept it honest on the show and it served me well.\"[30]\nSchumer co-starred in the Comedy Central reality show Reality Bites Back in 2008.[31] In 2009, she appeared in an advertising campaign for Butterfinger.[32] Schumer was a recurring guest on Fox News late-night program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld between 2007 and 2012.

I like tackling the stuff nobody else talks about, like the darkest, most serious thing about yourself. I talk about life and sex and personal stories and stuff everybody can relate to, and some can't.\"[38]\nIn June 2012, Schumer began work on a sketch comedy series for Comedy Central. The show included single-camera vignettes of Schumer playing \"heightened versions\" of herself.

That includes making dumb jokes involving race... You can call it a 'blind spot for racism' or 'lazy,' but you are wrong. It is a joke ... I am not racist.\"[70]\nThroughout 2015, several of Schumer's skits in Inside Amy Schumer went viral online, sparking think pieces regarding sex, feminism, and rape culture.[71][72][73][74]\nAfter a fatal shooting took place at a showing of Trainwreck in Louisiana, Schumer advocated for stricter gun control laws and increased mental health funding.[75]\nIn November  2015, Schumer posed nude for a photo by photographer Annie Leibovitz for 2016 edition of the Pirelli Calendar.[76] Schumer tweeted the photo, writing \"Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman.
