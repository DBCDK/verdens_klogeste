                "text": "no title\n\nDavid Jude Heyworth Law (born 29 December 1972)[1] is an English actor. He has received multiple award nominations including for two Academy Awards, four Golden Globes Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards and two British Academy Film Awards. In 2007, he received an Honorary C\u00e9sar and was named a knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to World Cinema Arts.[2][3] Born and raised in London, Law started acting in theatre. After finding small roles in feature films, Law gained recognition for his role in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. He found further critical and commercial success in Enemy at the Gates (2001), Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition (2002). He gave an acclaimed performance in the war film Cold Mountain (2003), earning him Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. Law went on to star in several commercially unsuccessful films, including Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004) and Alfie (2004). He then starred in romantic comedies Closer (2004) and The Holiday (2006) which were well-received. He also portrayed Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). In the 2010s, Law appeared in Repo Men (2010) and had supporting roles in Contagion (2011) and the 3D film Hugo (2011). The latter two received positive reviews from critics. In 2012, he starred in Anna Karenina (2012), Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects (2013), Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) and Paul Feig's Spy (2015). In 2017, he starred in The Young Pope and in 2018 portrayed Albus Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. His highest-grossing release was the superhero film Captain Marvel (2019), in which he played Yon-Rogg. Law has also had an accomplished career on stage, and has received nominations for three Laurence Olivier Awards and two Tony Awards. He has performed in several West End and Broadway productions.[4] Law was born in Lewisham, South London, the second child of junior and later on, comprehensive school, teachers Margaret Anne Heyworth and Peter Robert Law; his father later became, according to Law, \"the youngest headmaster in London.\"[2][5] His mother was adopted but was later reunited with her Welsh birth mother, Meinwen Parry.[6] He has a sister, Natasha.[5] Law was named after \"a bit of both\" the book Jude the Obscure and the Beatles song \"Hey Jude.\"[5] He grew up in Blackheath, an area in the Borough of Greenwich,[7] and was educated at John Ball Primary School in Blackheath and Kidbrooke School, before attending Alleyn's School.[5] Law had his breakthrough with the British crime drama Shopping, which also featured his future wife, Sadie Frost. In 1997, he became more widely known with his role in the Oscar Wilde biopic Wilde.[5] Law won the \"Most Promising Newcomer\" award from the Evening Standard British Film Awards for his role as Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, the glamorous young lover of Stephen Fry's Wilde.[8] In Andrew Niccol's science fiction film Gattaca, Law played the role of a disabled former swimming star living in a eugenics-obsessed dystopia.[5] In Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, he played the role of the ill-fated sex-worker murdered by an art dealer portrayed by Kevin Spacey. In 1998, Jude Law played in 'The Wisdom of Crocodiles'. For The Talented Mr. Ripley in 1999, Law learned to play the saxophone and earned an MTV Movie Award nomination with Matt Damon and Fiorello for performing the song \"Tu vu\u00f2 f\u00e0 l'americano\" by Renato Carosone and Nicola Salerno. The role earned him a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role,[9] as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2001, Law starred as Russian sniper Vasily Zaytsev in the film Enemy at the Gates, and learned ballet dancing for the film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).[10] In 2002, he played a mob hitman in Sam Mendes's 1930s period drama Road to Perdition. In 2003, he collaborated again with director Anthony Minghella, for Cold Mountain, earning Best Actor nominations from members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[5] Law, an admirer of Sir Laurence Olivier, suggested the actor's image be included in the 2004 film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Using the science of computer graphics, footage of the young Olivier was merged into the film, playing Dr. Totenkopf, a mysterious scientific genius and supervillain.[11][12] Also in 2004, Law portrayed the title character in Alfie, the remake of Bill Naughton's 1966 film, playing the role originated by Michael Caine;[5] and later took on another of Caine's earlier roles in the 2007 film Sleuth, adapted by Nobel Laureate in Literature Harold Pinter, while Caine played the role originated by Olivier.[13] In 2006, he portrayed the role of Kate Winslet's character's single-parent brother in the film The Holiday, a modern-day American romantic comedy written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law said he found it tricky to approach the contemporary role in this film. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation.[14] By the end of the year, Law was one of the Top Ten A-list of the most bankable film stars in Hollywood, according to the Ulmer Scale.[15] Law is one of three actors who took over the role of actor Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Along with Law, actors Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell portray \"three separate dimensions in the film.\"[16][17] He appeared opposite Forest Whitaker in the dark science fiction comedy Repo Men and as Dr. Watson in Guy Ritchie's adaption of Sherlock Holmes, alongside Robert Downey, Jr. and Rachel McAdams, as well as the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Law starred as a celebrity supermodel in the film Rage,[18] and blogger and \"prophet\" Alan Krumwiede in the 2011 medical thriller Contagion. In April 2017, it was announced that Law would be portraying a young Albus Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.[19][20] The film was released on 16 November 2018 to mixed reviews.[21][22] Law also portrayed Yon-Rogg in the 2019 superhero film Captain Marvel.[23] In 1989, Law received his first television role, in a film based on the Beatrix Potter children's book, The Tailor of Gloucester. Law would then go on to have minor roles in various British television series, including a two-year stint in the Granada TV produced ITV soap opera Families, and in the episode \"Shoscombe Old Place\" in ITV's Sherlock Holmes, as well as the leading role in the BFI /Channel 4 short The Crane. In May 2015, it was announced that Law would portray Lenny Belardo/Pius XIII, a conservative American Cardinal who is elected Pope in response to what is perceived as rampant liberalism in the Catholic Church.[24] A ten-episode series titled The Young Pope was jointly produced by Sky Atlantic and Canal+ with HBO, and directed by Academy Award winning director Paolo Sorrentino. The series began airing in various countries in October 2016.[25] Law reprised in the role in the spin-off series, The New Pope. In 1987, Law began acting with the National Youth Music Theatre.[26] He played various roles in the Edinburgh Fringe-awarded play The Ragged Child. One of his first major stage roles was Foxtrot Darling in Philip Ridley's The Fastest Clock in the Universe. Law went on to appear as Michael in the West End production of Jean Cocteau's tragicomedy Les Parents terribles, directed by Sean Mathias.[5] For this play, he was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Newcomer, and he received the Ian Charleson Award for Outstanding Newcomer. Following a title change to Indiscretions, the play was reworked and transferred to Broadway in 1995, where Law acted opposite Kathleen Turner, Roger Rees and Cynthia Nixon.[27][28] This role earned him a Tony Award nomination[29] and the Theatre World Award.[30] In May 2009, Law returned to the London stage to portray the title role in Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Donmar Warehouse West End season at Wyndham's Theatre. The BBC reported \"a fine and solid performance\" but included other reviews of Law's interpretation that were mixed.[31] There was a further run of the production at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25\u201330 August 2009.[32] In September 2009, the production transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre in New York City. Again, the critics failed to agree on the merit of Law's interpretation: London's Daily Mail found only positive reviews,[33] but The Washington Post felt that the much-anticipated performance was \"highly disappointing\".[34] Nonetheless, he was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.[35] In January 2010, at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards ceremony, he was presented with the John and Wendy Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance for his 2009 Hamlet.[36] In 2002, he directed a Respect for Animals anti-fur cinema commercial. The commercial, titled \"Fur and Against\", used music composed by Gary Kemp, and included appearances by Law, Chrissie Hynde, Moby, George Michael, Danny Goffey, Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Helena Christensen, Sir Paul McCartney, Melanie C, and Stella McCartney.[37] Since 2005, he has represented Dunhill as an \"apparel ambassador\" in Asia.[38] In 2008, he became the international face of Dunhill and began appearing in the worldwide advertising campaigns.[39] In 2008, Law became the face of the male perfume, Dior Homme Sport.[40][41][42] In 2016 he appeared alongside Japanese actor Shun Oguri in a commercial for Pepsi's \"Momotaro's Story\" campaign, as \"Oni\"[43] In early 2007, Law shot the short film Realtime Movie Trailer at Borough Market, South London. Instead of promoting a film, this \"trailer\", which appeared among regular trailers in selected cinemas across London starting 19 November 2007, advertised a live event, Realtime Movie by Polish artist Pawe\u0142 Althamer. Hundreds turned up for this unfilmed reenactment, in real time, of the sequence of events shown in Realtime Movie Trailer by the same actors, including Althamer as a Polish labourer, held on 30 November 2007. The performance was commissioned by Tate Modern as part of its \"The World as a Stage\" exhibition, which explored the boundaries between arts and reality.[44][45][46] In 2004, Law launched a campaign to raise \u00a32.5\u00a0million towards the Young Vic Theatre's \u00a312.5\u00a0million redevelopment project.[47][48] He is currently Chairman of the Young Vic committee and has said that he is proud to help make the Young Vic \"a nurturing bed\" for young directors.[49] In 2006, he joined Robbie Williams in the \"Soccer Aid\" celebrity football match to benefit UNICEF.[50] In 2006, he starred in an anthology of Samuel Beckett readings and performances directed by Anthony Minghella. With the Beckett Gala Evening at the Reading Town Hall, more than \u00a322,000 was donated for the Macmillan Cancer Support.[51] Also in 2006, Frost and Law directed a Shakespeare play in a South African orphanage. He travelled to Durban with Frost and their children to help children who have lost their parents to AIDS. In July 2007, as patron of the charity, he helped kick off the month-long tour of the AIDS-themed musical Thula Sizwe by the Young Zulu Warriors.[52] Also in 2007, he encouraged the Friends of the Earth/the Big Ask campaign, asking British government to take action against climate change.[53][54][55] Law does charity work for organisations such as Make Poverty History, the Rhys Daniels Trust, and the WAVE Trauma Centre.[56] He supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Pride of Britain Awards.[57][58][59][60] He is the chairman of the Music For Tomorrow Foundation to help rebuild Katrina-devastated New Orleans.[61][62] Law serves as an ambassador of the Prince of Wales' Children and the Arts Foundation.[63] He supports Breast Cancer Care,[64] and in December 2008 he supported the Willow Foundation with a small canvas for their campaign Stars on Canvas.[65] In April 2009 he supported the charity Education Africa with the gift of a mask he had painted and signed himself. The campaign was launched on eBay by Education Africa.[66] Law, alongside Judi Dench, helped save St Stephen's Church in Hampstead. They supported the campaign, which raised \u00a34.5\u00a0million to refurbish the Victorian church in North London. The building reopened in March 2009 as an arts and community centre.[67][68] In July 2007, Law and Jeremy Gilley were in Afghanistan over a period of ten days to document peace commitments and activities there for an upcoming film and for marking the UN International Day of Peace.[69][70] Accompanied by UNICEF Representative Catherine Mbengue, they travelled and filmed in dangerous areas of eastern Afghanistan with a film crew, interviewing children, government ministers, community leaders and UN officials.[71][72] They also filmed at schools and visited various UNICEF-supported programmes inside and outside the capital Kabul.[73][74] The efforts of Peace One Day are coordinated in celebration of the annual International Day of Peace, on 21 September.[75][76] The film, named The Day After Peace, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.[77][78][79] On 21 September 2008, the film was shown at a gala screening at the Royal Albert Hall.[80] On 30 August 2008, Law and Gilley returned to Afghanistan to help keep a momentum around Peace Day. They met President Hamid Karzai, top NATO and UN officials, and members of the aid community. They also screened the new documentary about the efforts in support of peace. The documentary features activities that took place throughout Afghanistan in 2007. It also highlights support from UNICEF and the WHO for the peaceful immunisation of 1.4\u00a0million children against polio in insecure areas.[81][82][83][84] In 2011, Law joined street protests against Alexander Lukashenko and his brutal crackdown on the Belarusian democracy movement.[85] Law's parents live in Vaudelnay, France, where they run their own drama school and theatre.[86] His sister Natasha is an illustrator and artist, living in London.[87][88] Law met actress Sadie Frost while working on the film Shopping. He and Frost married on 2 September 1997 and divorced on 29 October 2003. He has three children with her.[89] While filming Alfie (2004) in late 2003, Law and co-star Sienna Miller began a relationship and became engaged in 2004.[90] On 8 July 2005, Law issued a public apology to Miller for having an affair with his children's nanny.[91] Miller and Law broke up in November 2006.[92] Law became a father for the fourth time, following a brief relationship with American model Samantha Burke in 2008;[93][94] Burke gave birth to a daughter in September 2009.[95][96] His fifth child, a daughter, was born in 2015, to Catherine Harding.[97][98] He married his girlfriend Phillipa Coan on 1 May 2019.[99] for: Les Parents terribles (1994) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Anna Christie (2012) for: Ion (1995) for: 'Tis Pity She's a Whore (1999) for: Indiscretions (1995) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Indiscretions (1995) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Anna Christie (2011) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Hamlet (2010) for: Hamlet (2010)",

He has received multiple award nominations including for two Academy Awards, four Golden Globes Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards and two British Academy Film Awards. In 2007, he received an Honorary C\u00e9sar and was named a knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to World Cinema Arts.[2][3]\nBorn and raised in London, Law started acting in theatre. After finding small roles in feature films, Law gained recognition for his role in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. He found further critical and commercial success in Enemy at the Gates (2001), Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition (2002). He gave an acclaimed performance in the war film Cold Mountain (2003), earning him Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations.\nLaw went on to star in several commercially unsuccessful films, including Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004) and Alfie (2004). He then starred in romantic comedies Closer (2004) and The Holiday (2006) which were well-received. He also portrayed Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). In the 2010s, Law appeared in Repo Men (2010) and had supporting roles in Contagion (2011) and the 3D film Hugo (2011). The latter two received positive reviews from critics. In 2012, he starred in Anna Karenina (2012), Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects (2013), Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) and Paul Feig's Spy (2015). \nIn 2017, he starred in The Young Pope and in 2018 portrayed Albus Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. His highest-grossing release was the superhero film Captain Marvel (2019), in which he played Yon-Rogg. Law has also had an accomplished career on stage, and has received nominations for three Laurence Olivier Awards and two Tony Awards. He has performed in several West End and Broadway productions.[4]\nLaw was born in Lewisham, South London, the second child of junior and later on, comprehensive school, teachers Margaret Anne Heyworth and Peter Robert Law; his father later became, according to Law, \"the youngest headmaster in London.\"[2][5] His mother was adopted but was later reunited with her Welsh birth mother, Meinwen Parry.[6] He has a sister, Natasha.[5] Law was named after \"a bit of both\" the book Jude the Obscure and the Beatles song \"Hey Jude.\"[5] He grew up in Blackheath, an area in the Borough of Greenwich,[7] and was educated at John Ball Primary School in Blackheath and Kidbrooke School, before attending Alleyn's School.[5]\nLaw had his breakthrough with the British crime drama Shopping, which also featured his future wife, Sadie Frost.\nIn 1997, he became more widely known with his role in the Oscar Wilde biopic Wilde.[5] Law won the \"Most Promising Newcomer\" award from the Evening Standard British Film Awards for his role as Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, the glamorous young lover of Stephen Fry's Wilde.[8] In Andrew Niccol's science fiction film Gattaca, Law played the role of a disabled former swimming star living in a eugenics-obsessed dystopia.[5] In Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, he played the role of the ill-fated sex-worker murdered by an art dealer portrayed by Kevin Spacey.\nIn 1998, Jude Law played in 'The Wisdom of Crocodiles'.\nFor The Talented Mr. Ripley in 1999, Law learned to play the saxophone and earned an MTV Movie Award nomination with Matt Damon and Fiorello for performing the song \"Tu vu\u00f2 f\u00e0 l'americano\" by Renato Carosone and Nicola Salerno. The role earned him a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role,[9] as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nIn 2001, Law starred as Russian sniper Vasily Zaytsev in the film Enemy at the Gates, and learned ballet dancing for the film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).[10] In 2002, he played a mob hitman in Sam Mendes's 1930s period drama Road to Perdition. In 2003, he collaborated again with director Anthony Minghella, for Cold Mountain, earning Best Actor nominations from members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[5]\nLaw, an admirer of Sir Laurence Olivier, suggested the actor's image be included in the 2004 film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Using the science of computer graphics, footage of the young Olivier was merged into the film, playing Dr. Totenkopf, a mysterious scientific genius and supervillain.[11][12] Also in 2004, Law portrayed the title character in Alfie, the remake of Bill Naughton's 1966 film, playing the role originated by Michael Caine;[5] and later took on another of Caine's earlier roles in the 2007 film Sleuth, adapted by Nobel Laureate in Literature Harold Pinter, while Caine played the role originated by Olivier.[13]\nIn 2006, he portrayed the role of Kate Winslet's character's single-parent brother in the film The Holiday, a modern-day American romantic comedy written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law said he found it tricky to approach the contemporary role in this film. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation.[14] By the end of the year, Law was one of the Top Ten A-list of the most bankable film stars in Hollywood, according to the Ulmer Scale.[15]\nLaw is one of three actors who took over the role of actor Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Along with Law, actors Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell portray \"three separate dimensions in the film.\"[16][17] He appeared opposite Forest Whitaker in the dark science fiction comedy Repo Men and as Dr. Watson in Guy Ritchie's adaption of Sherlock Holmes, alongside Robert Downey, Jr. and Rachel McAdams, as well as the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Law starred as a celebrity supermodel in the film Rage,[18] and blogger and \"prophet\" Alan Krumwiede in the 2011 medical thriller Contagion.\nIn April 2017, it was announced that Law would be portraying a young Albus Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.[19][20] The film was released on 16 November 2018 to mixed reviews.[21][22] Law also portrayed Yon-Rogg in the 2019 superhero film Captain Marvel.[23]\nIn 1989, Law received his first television role, in a film based on the Beatrix Potter children's book, The Tailor of Gloucester. Law would then go on to have minor roles in various British television series, including a two-year stint in the Granada TV produced ITV soap opera Families, and in the episode \"Shoscombe Old Place\" in ITV's Sherlock Holmes, as well as the leading role in the BFI /Channel 4 short The Crane.\nIn May 2015, it was announced that Law would portray Lenny Belardo/Pius XIII, a conservative American Cardinal who is elected Pope in response to what is perceived as rampant liberalism in the Catholic Church.[24] A ten-episode series titled The Young Pope was jointly produced by Sky Atlantic and Canal+ with HBO, and directed by Academy Award winning director Paolo Sorrentino. The series began airing in various countries in October 2016.[25] Law reprised in the role in the spin-off series, The New Pope.\nIn 1987, Law began acting with the National Youth Music Theatre.[26] He played various roles in the Edinburgh Fringe-awarded play The Ragged Child. One of his first major stage roles was Foxtrot Darling in Philip Ridley's The Fastest Clock in the Universe. Law went on to appear as Michael in the West End production of Jean Cocteau's tragicomedy Les Parents terribles, directed by Sean Mathias.[5] For this play, he was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Newcomer, and he received the Ian Charleson Award for Outstanding Newcomer.\nFollowing a title change to Indiscretions, the play was reworked and transferred to Broadway in 1995, where Law acted opposite Kathleen Turner, Roger Rees and Cynthia Nixon.[27][28] This role earned him a Tony Award nomination[29] and the Theatre World Award.[30]\nIn May 2009, Law returned to the London stage to portray the title role in Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Donmar Warehouse West End season at Wyndham's Theatre. The BBC reported \"a fine and solid performance\" but included other reviews of Law's interpretation that were mixed.[31] There was a further run of the production at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25\u201330 August 2009.[32] In September 2009, the production transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre in New York City. Again, the critics failed to agree on the merit of Law's interpretation: London's Daily Mail found only positive reviews,[33] but The Washington Post felt that the much-anticipated performance was \"highly disappointing\".[34] Nonetheless, he was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.[35] In January 2010, at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards ceremony, he was presented with the John and Wendy Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance for his 2009 Hamlet.[36]\nIn 2002, he directed a Respect for Animals anti-fur cinema commercial. The commercial, titled \"Fur and Against\", used music composed by Gary Kemp, and included appearances by Law, Chrissie Hynde, Moby, George Michael, Danny Goffey, Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Helena Christensen, Sir Paul McCartney, Melanie C, and Stella McCartney.[37]\nSince 2005, he has represented Dunhill as an \"apparel ambassador\" in Asia.[38] In 2008, he became the international face of Dunhill and began appearing in the worldwide advertising campaigns.[39] In 2008, Law became the face of the male perfume, Dior Homme Sport.[40][41][42]\nIn 2016 he appeared alongside Japanese actor Shun Oguri in a commercial for Pepsi's \"Momotaro's Story\" campaign, as \"Oni\"[43]\nIn early 2007, Law shot the short film Realtime Movie Trailer at Borough Market, South London. Instead of promoting a film, this \"trailer\", which appeared among regular trailers in selected cinemas across London starting 19 November 2007, advertised a live event, Realtime Movie by Polish artist Pawe\u0142 Althamer. Hundreds turned up for this unfilmed reenactment, in real time, of the sequence of events shown in Realtime Movie Trailer by the same actors, including Althamer as a Polish labourer, held on 30 November 2007. The performance was commissioned by Tate Modern as part of its \"The World as a Stage\" exhibition, which explored the boundaries between arts and reality.[44][45][46]\nIn 2004, Law launched a campaign to raise \u00a32.5\u00a0million towards the Young Vic Theatre's \u00a312.5\u00a0million redevelopment project.[47][48] He is currently Chairman of the Young Vic committee and has said that he is proud to help make the Young Vic \"a nurturing bed\" for young directors.[49] In 2006, he joined Robbie Williams in the \"Soccer Aid\" celebrity football match to benefit UNICEF.[50]\nIn 2006, he starred in an anthology of Samuel Beckett readings and performances directed by Anthony Minghella. With the Beckett Gala Evening at the Reading Town Hall, more than \u00a322,000 was donated for the Macmillan Cancer Support.[51] Also in 2006, Frost and Law directed a Shakespeare play in a South African orphanage. He travelled to Durban with Frost and their children to help children who have lost their parents to AIDS. In July 2007, as patron of the charity, he helped kick off the month-long tour of the AIDS-themed musical Thula Sizwe by the Young Zulu Warriors.[52] Also in 2007, he encouraged the Friends of the Earth/the Big Ask campaign, asking British government to take action against climate change.[53][54][55]\nLaw does charity work for organisations such as Make Poverty History, the Rhys Daniels Trust, and the WAVE Trauma Centre.[56] He supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Pride of Britain Awards.[57][58][59][60]\nHe is the chairman of the Music For Tomorrow Foundation to help rebuild Katrina-devastated New Orleans.[61][62]\nLaw serves as an ambassador of the Prince of Wales' Children and the Arts Foundation.[63] He supports Breast Cancer Care,[64] and in December 2008 he supported the Willow Foundation with a small canvas for their campaign Stars on Canvas.[65] In April 2009 he supported the charity Education Africa with the gift of a mask he had painted and signed himself. The campaign was launched on eBay by Education Africa.[66]\nLaw, alongside Judi Dench, helped save St Stephen's Church in Hampstead. They supported the campaign, which raised \u00a34.5\u00a0million to refurbish the Victorian church in North London. The building reopened in March 2009 as an arts and community centre.[67][68]\nIn July 2007, Law and Jeremy Gilley were in Afghanistan over a period of ten days to document peace commitments and activities there for an upcoming film and for marking the UN International Day of Peace.[69][70] Accompanied by UNICEF Representative Catherine Mbengue, they travelled and filmed in dangerous areas of eastern Afghanistan with a film crew, interviewing children, government ministers, community leaders and UN officials.[71][72] They also filmed at schools and visited various UNICEF-supported programmes inside and outside the capital Kabul.[73][74] The efforts of Peace One Day are coordinated in celebration of the annual International Day of Peace, on 21 September.[75][76] The film, named The Day After Peace, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.[77][78][79] On 21 September 2008, the film was shown at a gala screening at the Royal Albert Hall.[80]\nOn 30 August 2008, Law and Gilley returned to Afghanistan to help keep a momentum around Peace Day. They met President Hamid Karzai, top NATO and UN officials, and members of the aid community. They also screened the new documentary about the efforts in support of peace. The documentary features activities that took place throughout Afghanistan in 2007. It also highlights support from UNICEF and the WHO for the peaceful immunisation of 1.4\u00a0million children against polio in insecure areas.[81][82][83][84]\nIn 2011, Law joined street protests against Alexander Lukashenko and his brutal crackdown on the Belarusian democracy movement.[85]\nLaw's parents live in Vaudelnay, France, where they run their own drama school and theatre.[86] His sister Natasha is an illustrator and artist, living in London.[87][88]\nLaw met actress Sadie Frost while working on the film Shopping. He and Frost married on 2 September 1997 and divorced on 29 October 2003. He has three children with her.[89] While filming Alfie (2004) in late 2003, Law and co-star Sienna Miller began a relationship and became engaged in 2004.[90] On 8 July 2005, Law issued a public apology to Miller for having an affair with his children's nanny.[91] Miller and Law broke up in November 2006.[92]\nLaw became a father for the fourth time, following a brief relationship with American model Samantha Burke in 2008;[93][94] Burke gave birth to a daughter in September 2009.[95][96] His fifth child, a daughter, was born in 2015, to Catherine Harding.[97][98] He married his girlfriend Phillipa Coan on 1 May 2019.[99]\nfor: Les Parents terribles (1994)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Anna Christie (2012)\nfor: Ion (1995)\nfor: 'Tis Pity She's a Whore (1999)\nfor: Indiscretions (1995)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Indiscretions (1995)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Anna Christie (2011)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\nfor: Hamlet (2010)\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg (/\u02c8be\u026ad\u0259r \u02c8\u0261\u026anzb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/, born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933)[1] is an American lawyer and jurist who is an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Ginsburg was appointed by President Bill Clinton and took the oath of office on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice (after Sandra Day O'Connor) of four to be confirmed to the court (along with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following O'Connor's retirement, and until Sotomayor joined the court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, which were noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the court. Ginsburg has authored notable majority opinions, including United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn, New York. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother, one of her biggest sources of encouragement, died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She then earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University, and became a wife and mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated tied for first in her class. Following law school, Ginsburg turned to academia. She was a professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field. Ginsburg spent a considerable part of her legal career as an advocate for the advancement of gender equality and women's rights, winning multiple victories arguing before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsels in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court. Ginsburg has received attention in American popular culture for her fiery liberal dissents and refusal to step down; she has been dubbed \"The Notorious R.B.G.\" in reference to the late rapper known as \"The Notorious B.I.G.\".[2] Joan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the second daughter of Celia (n\u00e9e Amster) and Nathan Bader, who lived in the Flatbush neighborhood. Her father was a Jewish emigrant from Odessa, Ukraine, then in the Russian Empire, and her mother was born in New York to Austrian Jewish parents.[3][4][5] The Baders' older daughter Marylin died of meningitis at age six, when Ruth was 14 months old.[1]:3[6][7] The family called Joan Ruth \"Kiki\", a nickname Marylin had given her for being \"a kicky baby\".[1]:3[8] When \"Kiki\" started school, Celia discovered that her daughter's class had several other girls named Joan, so Celia suggested that the teacher call her daughter \"Ruth\" to avoid confusion.[1]:3 Although not devout, the Bader family belonged to East Midwood Jewish Center, a Conservative synagogue, where Ruth learned tenets of the Jewish faith and gained familiarity with the Hebrew language.[1]:14\u201315 At age 13, Ruth acted as the \"camp rabbi\" at a Jewish summer program at Camp Che-Na-Wah in Minerva, New York.[8] Celia took an active role in her daughter's education, often taking her to the library.[8] Celia had been a good student in her youth, graduating from high school at age 15, yet she could not further her own education because her family instead chose to send her brother to college. Celia wanted her daughter to get more education, which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history teacher.[9] Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a courtroom in her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth's high school years and died the day before Ruth's high school graduation.[8] Bader attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where she was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi.[10] While at Cornell, she met Martin D. Ginsburg at age 17.[9] She graduated from Cornell with a bachelor of arts degree in government on June 23, 1954. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the highest-ranking female student in her graduating class.[10][11] Bader married Ginsburg a month after her graduation from Cornell. She and Martin moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he was stationed as a Reserve Officers' Training Corps officer in the Army Reserve after his call-up to active duty.[9][12][11] At age 21, she worked for the Social Security Administration office in Oklahoma, where she was demoted after becoming pregnant with her first child.[7] She gave birth to a daughter in 1955.[7] In the fall of 1956, Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School, where she was one of only nine women in a class of about 500 men.[13][14] The Dean of Harvard Law reportedly invited all of the female law students to dinner at his family home and asked the female law students, including Ginsburg, \"Why are you at Harvard Law School, taking the place of a man?\"[a][9][15][16] When her husband took a job in New York City, Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School and became the first woman to be on two major law reviews: the Harvard Law Review and Columbia Law Review. In 1959, she earned her law degree at Columbia and tied for first in her class.[8][17] At the start of her legal career, Ginsburg encountered difficulty in finding employment.[18][19][20] In 1960, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter rejected Ginsburg for a clerkship position due to her gender. She was rejected despite a strong recommendation from Albert Martin Sacks, who was a professor and later dean of Harvard Law School.[21][22][b] Columbia Law Professor Gerald Gunther also pushed for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to hire Ginsburg as a law clerk, threatening to never recommend another Columbia student to Palmieri if he did not give Ginsburg the opportunity and guaranteeing to provide the judge with a replacement clerk should Ginsburg not succeed.[7][8][23] Later that year, Ginsburg began her clerkship for Judge Palmieri, and she held the position for two years.[7][8] From 1961 to 1963, Ginsburg was a research associate and then an associate director of the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure; she learned Swedish to co-author a book with Anders Bruzelius on civil procedure in Sweden.[24][25] Ginsburg conducted extensive research for her book at Lund University in Sweden.[26] Ginsburg's time in Sweden also influenced her thinking on gender equality. She was inspired when she observed the changes in Sweden, where women were 20 to 25 percent of all law students; one of the judges whom Ginsburg watched for her research was eight months pregnant and still working.[9] Her first position as a professor was at Rutgers Law School in 1963.[27] The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues because she had a husband with a well-paid job.[20] At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than 20 female law professors in the United States.[27] She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.[28][29] In 1970, she co-founded the Women's Rights Law Reporter, the first law journal in the U.S. to focus exclusively on women's rights.[30] From 1972 to 1980, she taught at Columbia, where she became the first tenured woman and co-authored the first law school casebook on sex discrimination.[29] She also spent a year as a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University from 1977 to 1978.[31] In 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and, in 1973, she became the Project's general counsel.[11] The Women's Rights Project and related ACLU projects participated in over 300 gender discrimination cases by 1974. As the director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, she argued six gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976, winning five.[21] Rather than asking the court to end all gender discrimination at once, Ginsburg charted a strategic course, taking aim at specific discriminatory statutes and building on each successive victory. She chose plaintiffs carefully, at times picking male plaintiffs to demonstrate that gender discrimination was harmful to both men and women.[29][21] The laws Ginsburg targeted included those that on the surface appeared beneficial to women, but in fact reinforced the notion that women needed to be dependent on men.[21] Her strategic advocacy extended to word choice, favoring the use of \"gender\" instead of \"sex\", after her secretary suggested the word \"sex\" would serve as a distraction to judges.[29] She attained a reputation as a skilled oral advocate and her work led directly to the end of gender discrimination in many areas of the law.[32] Ginsburg volunteered to write the brief for Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), in which the Supreme Court extended the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to women.[29][33][c] She argued and won Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), which challenged a statute making it more difficult for a female service member to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued that the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8\u20131 in her favor.[21] The court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975), where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued that the statute discriminated against male survivors of workers by denying them the same protection as their female counterparts.[35] Ginsburg filed an amicus brief and sat with counsel at oral argument for Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), which challenged an Oklahoma statute that set different minimum drinking ages for men and women.[21][35] For the first time, the court imposed what is known as intermediate scrutiny on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review.[21][35][36] Her last case as a lawyer before the Supreme Court was 1978's Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979), which challenged the validity of voluntary jury duty for women, on the ground that participation in jury duty was a citizen's vital governmental service and therefore should not be optional for women. At the end of Ginsburg's oral argument, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, \"You won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?\"[37] Ginsburg said she considered responding, \"We won't settle for tokens\", but instead opted not to answer the question.[37] Legal scholars and advocates credit Ginsburg's body of work with making significant legal advances for women under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.[29][21] Taken together, Ginsburg's legal victories discouraged legislatures from treating women and men differently under the law.[29][21][35] She continued to work on the ACLU's Women's Rights Project until her appointment to the Federal Bench in 1980.[29] Later, colleague Antonin Scalia praised Ginsburg's skills as an advocate, \"she became the leading (and very successful) litigator on behalf of women's rights\u2014the Thurgood Marshall of that cause, so to speak\". This was a comparison that had first been made by former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold who was also her former professor and dean at Harvard Law School, in a speech given in 1985.[38][39][d] Ginsburg was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on April 14, 1980, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated by Judge Harold Leventhal after his death.[28] She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 18, 1980, and received her commission later that day.[28] Her service terminated on August 9, 1993, due to her elevation to the United States Supreme Court.[28][40][41] During her time as a judge on the DC Circuit, Ginsburg often found consensus with her colleagues including conservatives Robert H. Bork and Antonin Scalia.[42][43] Her time on the court earned her a reputation as a \"cautious jurist\" and a moderate.[44] David S. Tatel replaced her after Ginsburg's appointment to the Supreme Court.[45] President Bill Clinton nominated her as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on June 14, 1993, to fill the seat vacated by retiring Justice Byron White. Ginsburg was recommended to Clinton by then-U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno[17] after a suggestion by Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.[46] At the time of her nomination, Ginsburg was viewed as a moderate. Clinton was reportedly looking to increase the court's diversity, which Ginsburg did as the first Jewish justice since the 1969 resignation of Justice Abe Fortas. She was the second-ever female justice, and the first Jewish female justice.[44][47][48] She eventually became the longest-serving Jewish justice ever.[49] The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ginsburg as \"well qualified\", its highest possible rating for a prospective justice.[50] During her subsequent testimony before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary as part of the confirmation hearings, she refused to answer questions about her view on the constitutionality of some issues such as the death penalty as it was an issue that she might have to vote on if it came before the court.[51] At the same time, Ginsburg did answer questions about some potentially controversial issues. For instance, she affirmed her belief in a constitutional right to privacy and explained at some length her personal judicial philosophy and thoughts regarding gender equality.[52]:15\u201316 Ginsburg was more forthright in discussing her views on topics about which she had previously written.[51] The United States Senate confirmed her by a 96 to 3 vote on August 3, 1993,[e][28] she received her commission on August 5, 1993,[28] and she took her judicial oath on August 10, 1993.[54] Ginsburg's name was later invoked during the confirmation process of John Roberts. Ginsburg herself was not the first nominee to avoid answering certain specific questions before Congress,[f] and as a young lawyer in 1981 Roberts had advised against Supreme Court nominees' giving specific responses.[55] Nevertheless, some conservative commentators and Senators invoked the phrase \"Ginsburg precedent\" to defend his demurrers.[50][55] In a September 28, 2005, speech at Wake Forest University, Ginsburg said that Roberts' refusal to answer questions during his Senate confirmation hearings on some cases was \"unquestionably right\".[56] Ginsburg characterizes her performance on the court as a cautious approach to adjudication.[57] She argued in a speech shortly before her nomination to the court that \"[m]easured motions seem to me right, in the main, for constitutional as well as common law adjudication. Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable.\"[58] Legal scholar Cass Sunstein has characterized Ginsburg as a \"rational minimalist\", a jurist who seeks to build cautiously on precedent rather than pushing the Constitution towards her own vision.[59]:10\u201311 The retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006 left Ginsburg as the only woman on the court.[60][g] Linda Greenhouse of The New York Times referred to the subsequent 2006\u20132007 term of the court as \"the time when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg found her voice, and used it\".[62] The term also marked the first time in Ginsburg's history with the court where she read multiple dissents from the bench, a tactic employed to signal more intense disagreement with the majority.[62] With the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, Ginsburg became the senior member of what is sometimes referred to as the court's \"liberal wing\".[29][63][64] When the court splits 5\u20134 along ideological lines and the liberal justices are in the minority, Ginsburg often has the authority to assign authorship of the dissenting opinion because of her seniority.[63][h] Ginsburg has been a proponent of the liberal dissenters speaking \"with one voice\" and, where practicable, presenting a unified approach to which all of the dissenting justices can agree.[29][63] Ginsburg discussed her views on abortion and sexual equality in a 2009 New York Times interview, in which she said about abortion that \"[t]he basic thing is that the government has no business making that choice for a woman\".[66] Although Ginsburg has consistently supported abortion rights and joined in the court's opinion striking down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law in Stenberg v. Carhart 530 U.S. 914 (2000), on the 40th anniversary of the court's ruling in Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113 (1973), she criticized the decision in Roe as terminating a nascent democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.[67] Ginsburg was in the minority for Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), a 5\u20134 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings.[68] Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 15-274 (2016), a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue.[69] She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.[68][69] Ginsburg authored the court's opinion in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996), which struck down the Virginia Military Institute's (VMI) male-only admissions policy as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. VMI is a prestigious, state-run, military-inspired institution that did not admit women. For Ginsburg, a state actor such as VMI could not use gender to deny women the opportunity to attend VMI with its unique educational methods.[70] Ginsburg emphasized that the government must show an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" to use a classification based on sex.[71] Ginsburg dissented in the court's decision on Ledbetter v. Goodyear, 550 U.S. 618 (2007), a case where plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter filed a lawsuit against her employer claiming pay discrimination based on her gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In a 5\u20134 decision, the majority interpreted the statute of limitations as starting to run at the time of every pay period, even if a woman did not know she was being paid less than her male colleague until later. Ginsburg found the result absurd, pointing out that women often do not know they are being paid less, and therefore it was unfair to expect them to act at the time of each paycheck. She also called attention to the reluctance women may have in male-dominated fields to making waves by filing lawsuits over small amounts, choosing instead to wait until the disparity accumulates.[72] As part of her dissent, Ginsburg called on Congress to amend Title VII to undo the court's decision with legislation.[73] Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims, became law.[74][75] Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.[73][75] Although Ginsburg did not author the majority opinion, she was credited with influencing her colleagues on the case Safford Unified School District v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364 (2009).[76] The court ruled that a school went too far in ordering a 13-year-old female student to strip to her bra and underpants so female officials could search for drugs.[76] In an interview published prior to the court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not fully appreciate the effect of a strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, \"They have never been a 13-year-old girl.\"[77] In an 8\u20131 decision, the court agreed that the school's search went too far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.[76] In Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135 (2009), Ginsburg dissented from the court's decision not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Roberts' emphasis on suppression as a means to deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights.[78]:308 She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.[78]:309 Ginsburg has also advocated the use of foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions; this was a view that was not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow.[79] Ginsburg has expressed the view that consulting international law is a well-ingrained tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists.[80] Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; in her first argument before the court, Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), she cited two German cases.[81] In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.[80] At his request, Ginsburg administered Vice President Al Gore's oath of office to a second term during the second inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997.[82] She was the third woman to administer an inaugural oath of office.[83] Ginsburg is believed to be the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist.[84] Earlier that summer, the court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases.[85][86] Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.[85] The Supreme Court bar formerly inscribed its certificates \"in the year of our Lord\", which some Orthodox Jews opposed, and asked Ginsburg to object to. She did so, and due to her objection, Supreme Court bar members have since been given other choices of how to inscribe the year on their certificates.[87] Despite their ideological differences, Ginsburg considered Scalia her closest colleague on the court. The two justices often dined and attended the opera together.[88] In her spare time, Ginsburg has appeared in several operas in non-speaking supernumerary roles such as Die Fledermaus (2003) and Ariadne auf Naxos (1994 with Scalia, and 2009), and spoke lines penned by herself in The Daughter of the Regiment (2016).[89] In January 2012, Ginsburg went to Egypt for four days of discussions with judges, law school faculty, law school students, and legal experts.[90][91] In an interview with Al Hayat TV, she stated that the first requirement of a new constitution should be that it would \"safeguard basic fundamental human rights like our First Amendment\". Asked if Egypt should model its new constitution on those of other nations, she said Egypt should be \"aided by all Constitution-writing that has gone on since the end of World War II\", she cited the United States Constitution and Constitution of South Africa as documents she might look to if drafting a new constitution. She said the U.S. was fortunate to have a constitution authored by \"very wise\" men but pointed out that in the 1780s, no women were able to participate directly in the process, and slavery still existed in the U.S.[92] During three separate interviews that were conducted in July 2016, Ginsburg criticized presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, telling The New York Times and the Associated Press that she did not want to think about the possibility of a Trump presidency. She joked that she might consider moving to New Zealand.[93][94] She later apologized for commenting on the presumptive Republican nominee, calling her remarks \"ill advised\".[95] Ginsburg's first book, My Own Words published by Simon & Schuster, was released October 4, 2016.[96] The book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller List for hardcover nonfiction at No.\u00a012.[97] While promoting her book in October 2016 during an interview with Katie Couric, Ginsburg responded to a question about Colin Kaepernick choosing not to stand for the national anthem at sporting events calling the protest \"really dumb\". She later apologized for her criticism calling her earlier comments \"inappropriately dismissive and harsh\" and noting she had not been familiar with the incident and should have declined to respond to the question.[98][99][100] In 2018, Ginsburg expressed her support for the #MeToo movement, which encourages women to speak up about their experiences with sexual harassment.[101] She told an audience, \"It's about time. For so long women were silent, thinking there was nothing you could do about it, but now the law is on the side of women, or men, who encounter harassment and that's a good thing.\"[101] She also reflected on her own experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment, including a time when a chemistry professor at Cornell unsuccessfully attempted to trade her exam answers for sex.[101] A few days after Bader graduated from Cornell, she married Martin D. Ginsburg, who later became an internationally prominent tax lawyer. Upon her accession to the D.C. Circuit, the couple moved from New York to Washington, D.C., where her husband became professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. Their daughter, Jane C. Ginsburg (b. 1955), is a professor at Columbia Law School. Their son, James Steven Ginsburg (b. 1965), is the founder and president of Cedille Records, a classical music recording company based in Chicago, Illinois. Ginsburg is a grandmother of four.[102] After the birth of their daughter, her husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer. During this period, Ginsburg attended class and took notes for both of them, typed her husband's dictated papers and cared for their daughter and her sick husband\u2014all while making the Harvard Law Review. They celebrated their 56th wedding anniversary on June 23, 2010. Martin Ginsburg died of complications from metastatic cancer on June 27, 2010.[103] They spoke publicly of being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage including in a speech Martin Ginsburg wrote and had intended to give before his death that Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered posthumously.[104] Although Bader was raised in a Jewish home, she became non-observant when she was excluded from the minyan for mourners after the death of her mother. There was a \"house full of women\", but Bader, as a woman, was excluded. Orthodox Judaism requires that 10 Jewish men (over the age of 13) be present for a minyan, and women are excluded from being counted. She notes that her attitude might be different, following her attendance at a bat mitzvah ceremony in a more liberal stream of Judaism where the rabbi and cantor were both women.[105] In March 2015, Ginsburg and Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt released \"The Heroic and Visionary Women of Passover\", an essay highlighting the roles of five key women in the saga: \"These women had a vision leading out of the darkness shrouding their world. They were women of action, prepared to defy authority to make their vision a reality bathed in the light of the day.\"[106] In addition, she decorates her chambers with an artist's rendering of the Hebrew phrase from Deuteronomy, \"Zedek, zedek, tirdof\", (\"Justice, justice shall you pursue\") as a reminder of her heritage and professional responsibility.[107] Following her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993, Ginsburg deviated from court tradition by wearing a French robe d'avocat, as opposed to the traditional American judicial robe. The French robe differs from the American with its exposed buttons, open sleeves, standing collar, and white rabat. On the left shoulder of the robe are two buttons intended for the fastening of an epitoge, traditionally worn by French lawyers. In later years, Ginsburg would shift from the traditionally uniform white French rabat and begin wearing more varied and fanciful jabots, necklaces, and other forms of neckwear. Some time later, fellow female Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor would follow Ginsburg's lead and begin wearing the French robe d'avocat as well. Ginsburg has a collection of lace jabots from around the world.[108][109] She stated in 2014 that she has a particular jabot that she wears when issuing her dissents (black with gold embroidery and faceted stones) as well as another she wears when issuing majority opinions (crocheted yellow and cream with crystals), which was a gift from her law clerks.[108][109] Her favorite jabot (woven with white beads) is from Cape Town, South Africa.[108] In 1999, Ginsburg was diagnosed with colon cancer; she underwent surgery that was followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. During the process, she did not miss a day on the bench.[110] Ginsburg was physically weakened by the cancer treatment, and she began working with a personal trainer. Since 1999, Bryant Johnson, a former Army reservist attached to the Special Forces, has trained Ginsburg twice weekly in the justices-only gym at the Supreme Court.[111][112] In spite of her small stature, Ginsburg saw her physical fitness improve since her first bout with cancer; she was able to complete 20 push-ups in a session before her 80th birthday.[111][113] On February 5, 2009, she again underwent surgery, this time for pancreatic cancer.[114][115] Ginsburg had a tumor that was discovered at an early stage.[114] She was released from a New York City hospital on February 13 and returned to the bench when the Supreme Court went back into session on February 23, 2009.[116][117][118] On September 24, 2009, Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington, DC, for lightheadedness following an outpatient treatment for iron deficiency and was released the following day.[119] On November 26, 2014, she had a stent placed in her right coronary artery after experiencing discomfort while exercising in the Supreme Court gym with her personal trainer.[120][121] On November 8, 2018, she was hospitalized after fracturing three ribs in a fall in her office at the Supreme Court.[122] A day later, it was reported that Ginsburg had returned to official judicial work after a day of observation.[123][124] An outpouring of public support followed.[125][126] A CT scan of her ribs following her November 8 fall showed cancerous nodules in her lungs.[127] On December 21, Ginsburg underwent a left-lung lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to remove the nodules.[127] On January 7, 2019, for the first time since joining the Court more than 25 years earlier, Ginsburg missed oral argument while she recuperated.[128] She returned to the Supreme Court on February 15, 2019, to participate in a private conference with other justices in her first appearance at the court since her cancer surgery in December 2018.[129] On August 24, 2019, it was revealed that Ginsburg had recently completed three weeks of focused radiation treatment to ablate a tumor found in her pancreas over the summer.[130] On January 7, 2020, Ginsburg reported that she is cancer free.[131] When John Paul Stevens retired in 2010, Ginsburg became the oldest justice on the court at age 77.[132] Despite rumors that she would retire because of advancing age, poor health, and the death of her husband,[133][134] she denied she was planning to step down. In an August 2010 interview, Ginsburg stated that her work on the court was helping her cope with the death of her husband.[132] She also expressed a wish to emulate Justice Louis Brandeis' service of nearly 23 years, which she achieved in April 2016.[132][135] She stated she has a new \"model\" to emulate in former colleague Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired at age 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench.[135] During the presidency of Barack Obama, some progressive lawyers and activists called for Ginsburg to retire so that Obama would be able to appoint a like-minded successor,[136][137][138] particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate.[139] They pointed to Ginsburg's age and past health issues as factors making her longevity uncertain.[137] Ginsburg rejected these pleas.[63] She affirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties.[63] Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.[140] As of October 2019, Ginsburg is the fourth-oldest serving Supreme Court Justice ever, at age 86. [141] In 2002, Ginsburg was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[142] Ginsburg has been named one of 100 Most Powerful Women (2009),[143] one of Glamour magazine's Women of the Year 2012,[144] and one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people (2015).[145] She has been awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees by Willamette University (2009),[146] Princeton University (2010),[147] and Harvard University (2011).[148] In 2013, a painting featuring the four female justices to have served as justices on the Supreme Court (Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan) was unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[149][150] Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave a species of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a resemblance to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.[151][152] Ginsberg was the recipient of the 2019 US $1 million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture.[153] Awarded annually, the Berggruen Institute stated it recognizes \"thinkers whose ideas have profoundly shaped human self-understanding and advancement in a rapidly changing world,\"[154] noting Ginsberg as \"a lifelong trailblazer for human rights and gender equality.\"[155] In 2019, the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles created Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a major exhibition focusing on Ginsberg's life and career.[156][157][158][159] Ginsburg has been referred to as a \"pop culture icon\".[160][161][162] Ginsburg's profile began to rise after O'Connor's retirement in 2006 left Ginsburg as the only serving female justice. Her increasingly fiery dissents, particularly in Shelby County v. Holder 570 U.S. 2 (2013), led to the creation of the Notorious R.B.G. Tumblr and Internet meme comparing the justice to rapper The Notorious B.I.G.[163] The creator of the Notorious R.B.G. Tumblr, then-law student Shana Knizhnik, teamed up with MSNBC reporter Irin Carmon to turn the blog into a book titled Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[164] Released in October 2015, the book became a New York Times bestseller.[165] In 2015, Ginsburg and Scalia, known for their shared love of opera, were fictionalized in Scalia/Ginsburg, an opera by Derrick Wang.[166] Additionally, Ginsburg's pop culture appeal has inspired nail art, Halloween costumes, a bobblehead doll, tattoos, t-shirts, coffee mugs, and a children's coloring book among other things.[164][167][168][169] She appears in both a comic opera and a workout book.[169] Musician Jonathan Mann also made a song using part of her Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. dissent.[170] Ginsburg has admitted to having a \"large supply\" of Notorious R.B.G. t-shirts, which she distributes as gifts.[171] Since 2015, Ginsburg has been portrayed by Kate McKinnon on Saturday Night Live.[172] McKinnon has repeatedly reprised the role, including during a Weekend Update sketch that aired from the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.[173][174] The segments typically feature McKinnon-as-Ginsburg lobbing insults she calls \"Ginsburns\" and doing a celebratory dance.[175][176] Filmmakers Betsy West and Julie Cohen created a documentary about Ginsburg, titled RBG, for CNN Films, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.[177][23] In the film Deadpool 2 (2018), a photo of her is shown as Deadpool considers her for his X-Force, a team of superheroes.[178] Another film, On the Basis of Sex, focusing on Ginsburg's career struggles fighting for equal rights, was released later in 2018; its screenplay was named to the Black List of best unproduced screenplays of 2014.[179] English actress Felicity Jones portrays Ginsburg in the film, with Armie Hammer as her husband Marty.[180] Ginsburg herself has a cameo in the film.[181] The seventh season of the sitcom New Girl features a three-year-old character named Ruth Bader Schmidt, named after Ginsburg.[182] A Lego mini-figurine of Ginsburg is shown within a brief segment of The Lego Movie 2. Ginsburg gave her blessing for the cameo, as well as to have the mini-figurine produced as part of the Lego toy sets following the film's release in February 2019.[183] Also in 2019, Samuel Adams released a limited-edition beer called When There Are Nine, referring to Ginsburg's well-known reply to the question about when there would be enough women on the Supreme Court.[184]",

Ginsburg was appointed by President Bill Clinton and took the oath of office on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice (after Sandra Day O'Connor) of four to be confirmed to the court (along with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following O'Connor's retirement, and until Sotomayor joined the court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, which were noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the court. Ginsburg has authored notable majority opinions, including United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.\nGinsburg was born in Brooklyn, New York. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother, one of her biggest sources of encouragement, died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She then earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University, and became a wife and mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated tied for first in her class. Following law school, Ginsburg turned to academia. She was a professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.\nGinsburg spent a considerable part of her legal career as an advocate for the advancement of gender equality and women's rights, winning multiple victories arguing before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsels in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court. Ginsburg has received attention in American popular culture for her fiery liberal dissents and refusal to step down; she has been dubbed \"The Notorious R.B.G.\" in reference to the late rapper known as \"The Notorious B.I.G.\".[2]\nJoan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the second daughter of Celia (n\u00e9e Amster) and Nathan Bader, who lived in the Flatbush neighborhood. Her father was a Jewish emigrant from Odessa, Ukraine, then in the Russian Empire, and her mother was born in New York to Austrian Jewish parents.[3][4][5] The Baders' older daughter Marylin died of meningitis at age six, when Ruth was 14 months old.[1]:3[6][7] The family called Joan Ruth \"Kiki\", a nickname Marylin had given her for being \"a kicky baby\".[1]:3[8] When \"Kiki\" started school, Celia discovered that her daughter's class had several other girls named Joan, so Celia suggested that the teacher call her daughter \"Ruth\" to avoid confusion.[1]:3 Although not devout, the Bader family belonged to East Midwood Jewish Center, a Conservative synagogue, where Ruth learned tenets of the Jewish faith and gained familiarity with the Hebrew language.[1]:14\u201315 At age 13, Ruth acted as the \"camp rabbi\" at a Jewish summer program at Camp Che-Na-Wah in Minerva, New York.[8]\nCelia took an active role in her daughter's education, often taking her to the library.[8] Celia had been a good student in her youth, graduating from high school at age 15, yet she could not further her own education because her family instead chose to send her brother to college. Celia wanted her daughter to get more education, which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history teacher.[9] Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a courtroom in her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth's high school years and died the day before Ruth's high school graduation.[8]\nBader attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where she was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi.[10] While at Cornell, she met Martin D. Ginsburg at age 17.[9] She graduated from Cornell with a bachelor of arts degree in government on June 23, 1954. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the highest-ranking female student in her graduating class.[10][11] Bader married Ginsburg a month after her graduation from Cornell. She and Martin moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he was stationed as a Reserve Officers' Training Corps officer in the Army Reserve after his call-up to active duty.[9][12][11] At age 21, she worked for the Social Security Administration office in Oklahoma, where she was demoted after becoming pregnant with her first child.[7] She gave birth to a daughter in 1955.[7]\nIn the fall of 1956, Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School, where she was one of only nine women in a class of about 500 men.[13][14] The Dean of Harvard Law reportedly invited all of the female law students to dinner at his family home and asked the female law students, including Ginsburg, \"Why are you at Harvard Law School, taking the place of a man?\"[a][9][15][16] When her husband took a job in New York City, Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School and became the first woman to be on two major law reviews: the Harvard Law Review and Columbia Law Review. In 1959, she earned her law degree at Columbia and tied for first in her class.[8][17]\nAt the start of her legal career, Ginsburg encountered difficulty in finding employment.[18][19][20] In 1960, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter rejected Ginsburg for a clerkship position due to her gender. She was rejected despite a strong recommendation from Albert Martin Sacks, who was a professor and later dean of Harvard Law School.[21][22][b] Columbia Law Professor Gerald Gunther also pushed for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to hire Ginsburg as a law clerk, threatening to never recommend another Columbia student to Palmieri if he did not give Ginsburg the opportunity and guaranteeing to provide the judge with a replacement clerk should Ginsburg not succeed.[7][8][23] Later that year, Ginsburg began her clerkship for Judge Palmieri, and she held the position for two years.[7][8]\nFrom 1961 to 1963, Ginsburg was a research associate and then an associate director of the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure; she learned Swedish to co-author a book with Anders Bruzelius on civil procedure in Sweden.[24][25] Ginsburg conducted extensive research for her book at Lund University in Sweden.[26] Ginsburg's time in Sweden also influenced her thinking on gender equality. She was inspired when she observed the changes in Sweden, where women were 20 to 25 percent of all law students; one of the judges whom Ginsburg watched for her research was eight months pregnant and still working.[9]\nHer first position as a professor was at Rutgers Law School in 1963.[27] The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues because she had a husband with a well-paid job.[20] At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than 20 female law professors in the United States.[27] She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.[28][29]\nIn 1970, she co-founded the Women's Rights Law Reporter, the first law journal in the U.S. to focus exclusively on women's rights.[30] From 1972 to 1980, she taught at Columbia, where she became the first tenured woman and co-authored the first law school casebook on sex discrimination.[29] She also spent a year as a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University from 1977 to 1978.[31]\nIn 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and, in 1973, she became the Project's general counsel.[11] The Women's Rights Project and related ACLU projects participated in over 300 gender discrimination cases by 1974. As the director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, she argued six gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976, winning five.[21] Rather than asking the court to end all gender discrimination at once, Ginsburg charted a strategic course, taking aim at specific discriminatory statutes and building on each successive victory. She chose plaintiffs carefully, at times picking male plaintiffs to demonstrate that gender discrimination was harmful to both men and women.[29][21] The laws Ginsburg targeted included those that on the surface appeared beneficial to women, but in fact reinforced the notion that women needed to be dependent on men.[21] Her strategic advocacy extended to word choice, favoring the use of \"gender\" instead of \"sex\", after her secretary suggested the word \"sex\" would serve as a distraction to judges.[29] She attained a reputation as a skilled oral advocate and her work led directly to the end of gender discrimination in many areas of the law.[32]\nGinsburg volunteered to write the brief for Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), in which the Supreme Court extended the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to women.[29][33][c] She argued and won Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), which challenged a statute making it more difficult for a female service member to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued that the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8\u20131 in her favor.[21] The court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975), where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued that the statute discriminated against male survivors of workers by denying them the same protection as their female counterparts.[35]\nGinsburg filed an amicus brief and sat with counsel at oral argument for Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), which challenged an Oklahoma statute that set different minimum drinking ages for men and women.[21][35] For the first time, the court imposed what is known as intermediate scrutiny on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review.[21][35][36] Her last case as a lawyer before the Supreme Court was 1978's Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979), which challenged the validity of voluntary jury duty for women, on the ground that participation in jury duty was a citizen's vital governmental service and therefore should not be optional for women. At the end of Ginsburg's oral argument, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, \"You won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?\"[37] Ginsburg said she considered responding, \"We won't settle for tokens\", but instead opted not to answer the question.[37]\nLegal scholars and advocates credit Ginsburg's body of work with making significant legal advances for women under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.[29][21] Taken together, Ginsburg's legal victories discouraged legislatures from treating women and men differently under the law.[29][21][35] She continued to work on the ACLU's Women's Rights Project until her appointment to the Federal Bench in 1980.[29] Later, colleague Antonin Scalia praised Ginsburg's skills as an advocate, \"she became the leading (and very successful) litigator on behalf of women's rights\u2014the Thurgood Marshall of that cause, so to speak\". This was a comparison that had first been made by former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold who was also her former professor and dean at Harvard Law School, in a speech given in 1985.[38][39][d]\nGinsburg was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on April 14, 1980, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated by Judge Harold Leventhal after his death.[28] She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 18, 1980, and received her commission later that day.[28] Her service terminated on August 9, 1993, due to her elevation to the United States Supreme Court.[28][40][41] During her time as a judge on the DC Circuit, Ginsburg often found consensus with her colleagues including conservatives Robert H. Bork and Antonin Scalia.[42][43] Her time on the court earned her a reputation as a \"cautious jurist\" and a moderate.[44] David S. Tatel replaced her after Ginsburg's appointment to the Supreme Court.[45]\nPresident Bill Clinton nominated her as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on June 14, 1993, to fill the seat vacated by retiring Justice Byron White. Ginsburg was recommended to Clinton by then-U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno[17] after a suggestion by Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.[46] At the time of her nomination, Ginsburg was viewed as a moderate. Clinton was reportedly looking to increase the court's diversity, which Ginsburg did as the first Jewish justice since the 1969 resignation of Justice Abe Fortas. She was the second-ever female justice, and the first Jewish female justice.[44][47][48] She eventually became the longest-serving Jewish justice ever.[49] The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ginsburg as \"well qualified\", its highest possible rating for a prospective justice.[50]\nDuring her subsequent testimony before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary as part of the confirmation hearings, she refused to answer questions about her view on the constitutionality of some issues such as the death penalty as it was an issue that she might have to vote on if it came before the court.[51]\nAt the same time, Ginsburg did answer questions about some potentially controversial issues. For instance, she affirmed her belief in a constitutional right to privacy and explained at some length her personal judicial philosophy and thoughts regarding gender equality.[52]:15\u201316 Ginsburg was more forthright in discussing her views on topics about which she had previously written.[51] The United States Senate confirmed her by a 96 to 3 vote on August 3, 1993,[e][28] she received her commission on August 5, 1993,[28] and she took her judicial oath on August 10, 1993.[54]\nGinsburg's name was later invoked during the confirmation process of John Roberts. Ginsburg herself was not the first nominee to avoid answering certain specific questions before Congress,[f] and as a young lawyer in 1981 Roberts had advised against Supreme Court nominees' giving specific responses.[55] Nevertheless, some conservative commentators and Senators invoked the phrase \"Ginsburg precedent\" to defend his demurrers.[50][55] In a September 28, 2005, speech at Wake Forest University, Ginsburg said that Roberts' refusal to answer questions during his Senate confirmation hearings on some cases was \"unquestionably right\".[56]\nGinsburg characterizes her performance on the court as a cautious approach to adjudication.[57] She argued in a speech shortly before her nomination to the court that \"[m]easured motions seem to me right, in the main, for constitutional as well as common law adjudication. Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable.\"[58] Legal scholar Cass Sunstein has characterized Ginsburg as a \"rational minimalist\", a jurist who seeks to build cautiously on precedent rather than pushing the Constitution towards her own vision.[59]:10\u201311\nThe retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006 left Ginsburg as the only woman on the court.[60][g] Linda Greenhouse of The New York Times referred to the subsequent 2006\u20132007 term of the court as \"the time when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg found her voice, and used it\".[62] The term also marked the first time in Ginsburg's history with the court where she read multiple dissents from the bench, a tactic employed to signal more intense disagreement with the majority.[62]\nWith the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, Ginsburg became the senior member of what is sometimes referred to as the court's \"liberal wing\".[29][63][64] When the court splits 5\u20134 along ideological lines and the liberal justices are in the minority, Ginsburg often has the authority to assign authorship of the dissenting opinion because of her seniority.[63][h] Ginsburg has been a proponent of the liberal dissenters speaking \"with one voice\" and, where practicable, presenting a unified approach to which all of the dissenting justices can agree.[29][63]\nGinsburg discussed her views on abortion and sexual equality in a 2009 New York Times interview, in which she said about abortion that \"[t]he basic thing is that the government has no business making that choice for a woman\".[66] Although Ginsburg has consistently supported abortion rights and joined in the court's opinion striking down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law in Stenberg v. Carhart 530 U.S. 914 (2000), on the 40th anniversary of the court's ruling in Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113 (1973), she criticized the decision in Roe as terminating a nascent democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.[67]\nGinsburg was in the minority for Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), a 5\u20134 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings.[68] Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 15-274 (2016), a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue.[69] She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.[68][69]\nGinsburg authored the court's opinion in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996), which struck down the Virginia Military Institute's (VMI) male-only admissions policy as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. VMI is a prestigious, state-run, military-inspired institution that did not admit women. For Ginsburg, a state actor such as VMI could not use gender to deny women the opportunity to attend VMI with its unique educational methods.[70] Ginsburg emphasized that the government must show an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" to use a classification based on sex.[71]\nGinsburg dissented in the court's decision on Ledbetter v. Goodyear, 550 U.S. 618 (2007), a case where plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter filed a lawsuit against her employer claiming pay discrimination based on her gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In a 5\u20134 decision, the majority interpreted the statute of limitations as starting to run at the time of every pay period, even if a woman did not know she was being paid less than her male colleague until later. Ginsburg found the result absurd, pointing out that women often do not know they are being paid less, and therefore it was unfair to expect them to act at the time of each paycheck. She also called attention to the reluctance women may have in male-dominated fields to making waves by filing lawsuits over small amounts, choosing instead to wait until the disparity accumulates.[72] As part of her dissent, Ginsburg called on Congress to amend Title VII to undo the court's decision with legislation.[73] Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims, became law.[74][75] Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.[73][75]\nAlthough Ginsburg did not author the majority opinion, she was credited with influencing her colleagues on the case Safford Unified School District v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364 (2009).[76] The court ruled that a school went too far in ordering a 13-year-old female student to strip to her bra and underpants so female officials could search for drugs.[76] In an interview published prior to the court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not fully appreciate the effect of a strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, \"They have never been a 13-year-old girl.\"[77] In an 8\u20131 decision, the court agreed that the school's search went too far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.[76]\nIn Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135 (2009), Ginsburg dissented from the court's decision not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Roberts' emphasis on suppression as a means to deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights.[78]:308 She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.[78]:309\nGinsburg has also advocated the use of foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions; this was a view that was not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow.[79] Ginsburg has expressed the view that consulting international law is a well-ingrained tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists.[80] Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; in her first argument before the court, Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), she cited two German cases.[81] In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.[80]\nAt his request, Ginsburg administered Vice President Al Gore's oath of office to a second term during the second inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997.[82] She was the third woman to administer an inaugural oath of office.[83] Ginsburg is believed to be the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist.[84] Earlier that summer, the court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases.[85][86] Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.[85]\nThe Supreme Court bar formerly inscribed its certificates \"in the year of our Lord\", which some Orthodox Jews opposed, and asked Ginsburg to object to. She did so, and due to her objection, Supreme Court bar members have since been given other choices of how to inscribe the year on their certificates.[87]\nDespite their ideological differences, Ginsburg considered Scalia her closest colleague on the court. The two justices often dined and attended the opera together.[88] In her spare time, Ginsburg has appeared in several operas in non-speaking supernumerary roles such as Die Fledermaus (2003) and Ariadne auf Naxos (1994 with Scalia, and 2009), and spoke lines penned by herself in The Daughter of the Regiment (2016).[89]\nIn January 2012, Ginsburg went to Egypt for four days of discussions with judges, law school faculty, law school students, and legal experts.[90][91] In an interview with Al Hayat TV, she stated that the first requirement of a new constitution should be that it would \"safeguard basic fundamental human rights like our First Amendment\". Asked if Egypt should model its new constitution on those of other nations, she said Egypt should be \"aided by all Constitution-writing that has gone on since the end of World War II\", she cited the United States Constitution and Constitution of South Africa as documents she might look to if drafting a new constitution. She said the U.S. was fortunate to have a constitution authored by \"very wise\" men but pointed out that in the 1780s, no women were able to participate directly in the process, and slavery still existed in the U.S.[92]\nDuring three separate interviews that were conducted in July 2016, Ginsburg criticized presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, telling The New York Times and the Associated Press that she did not want to think about the possibility of a Trump presidency. She joked that she might consider moving to New Zealand.[93][94] She later apologized for commenting on the presumptive Republican nominee, calling her remarks \"ill advised\".[95]\nGinsburg's first book, My Own Words published by Simon &amp; Schuster, was released October 4, 2016.[96] The book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller List for hardcover nonfiction at No.\u00a012.[97] While promoting her book in October 2016 during an interview with Katie Couric, Ginsburg responded to a question about Colin Kaepernick choosing not to stand for the national anthem at sporting events calling the protest \"really dumb\". She later apologized for her criticism calling her earlier comments \"inappropriately dismissive and harsh\" and noting she had not been familiar with the incident and should have declined to respond to the question.[98][99][100]\nIn 2018, Ginsburg expressed her support for the #MeToo movement, which encourages women to speak up about their experiences with sexual harassment.[101] She told an audience, \"It's about time. For so long women were silent, thinking there was nothing you could do about it, but now the law is on the side of women, or men, who encounter harassment and that's a good thing.\"[101] She also reflected on her own experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment, including a time when a chemistry professor at Cornell unsuccessfully attempted to trade her exam answers for sex.[101]\nA few days after Bader graduated from Cornell, she married Martin D. Ginsburg, who later became an internationally prominent tax lawyer. Upon her accession to the D.C. Circuit, the couple moved from New York to Washington, D.C., where her husband became professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. Their daughter, Jane C. Ginsburg (b. 1955), is a professor at Columbia Law School. Their son, James Steven Ginsburg (b. 1965), is the founder and president of Cedille Records, a classical music recording company based in Chicago, Illinois. Ginsburg is a grandmother of four.[102]\nAfter the birth of their daughter, her husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer. During this period, Ginsburg attended class and took notes for both of them, typed her husband's dictated papers and cared for their daughter and her sick husband\u2014all while making the Harvard Law Review. They celebrated their 56th wedding anniversary on June 23, 2010. Martin Ginsburg died of complications from metastatic cancer on June 27, 2010.[103] They spoke publicly of being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage including in a speech Martin Ginsburg wrote and had intended to give before his death that Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered posthumously.[104]\nAlthough Bader was raised in a Jewish home, she became non-observant when she was excluded from the minyan for mourners after the death of her mother. There was a \"house full of women\", but Bader, as a woman, was excluded. Orthodox Judaism requires that 10 Jewish men (over the age of 13) be present for a minyan, and women are excluded from being counted. She notes that her attitude might be different, following her attendance at a bat mitzvah ceremony in a more liberal stream of Judaism where the rabbi and cantor were both women.[105] In March 2015, Ginsburg and Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt released \"The Heroic and Visionary Women of Passover\", an essay highlighting the roles of five key women in the saga: \"These women had a vision leading out of the darkness shrouding their world. They were women of action, prepared to defy authority to make their vision a reality bathed in the light of the day.\"[106] In addition, she decorates her chambers with an artist's rendering of the Hebrew phrase from Deuteronomy, \"Zedek, zedek, tirdof\", (\"Justice, justice shall you pursue\") as a reminder of her heritage and professional responsibility.[107]\nFollowing her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993, Ginsburg deviated from court tradition by wearing a French robe d'avocat, as opposed to the traditional American judicial robe. The French robe differs from the American with its exposed buttons, open sleeves, standing collar, and white rabat. On the left shoulder of the robe are two buttons intended for the fastening of an epitoge, traditionally worn by French lawyers. In later years, Ginsburg would shift from the traditionally uniform white French rabat and begin wearing more varied and fanciful jabots, necklaces, and other forms of neckwear. Some time later, fellow female Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor would follow Ginsburg's lead and begin wearing the French robe d'avocat as well.\nGinsburg has a collection of lace jabots from around the world.[108][109] She stated in 2014 that she has a particular jabot that she wears when issuing her dissents (black with gold embroidery and faceted stones) as well as another she wears when issuing majority opinions (crocheted yellow and cream with crystals), which was a gift from her law clerks.[108][109] Her favorite jabot (woven with white beads) is from Cape Town, South Africa.[108]\nIn 1999, Ginsburg was diagnosed with colon cancer; she underwent surgery that was followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. During the process, she did not miss a day on the bench.[110] Ginsburg was physically weakened by the cancer treatment, and she began working with a personal trainer. Since 1999, Bryant Johnson, a former Army reservist attached to the Special Forces, has trained Ginsburg twice weekly in the justices-only gym at the Supreme Court.[111][112] In spite of her small stature, Ginsburg saw her physical fitness improve since her first bout with cancer; she was able to complete 20 push-ups in a session before her 80th birthday.[111][113]\nOn February 5, 2009, she again underwent surgery, this time for pancreatic cancer.[114][115] Ginsburg had a tumor that was discovered at an early stage.[114] She was released from a New York City hospital on February 13 and returned to the bench when the Supreme Court went back into session on February 23, 2009.[116][117][118] On September 24, 2009, Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington, DC, for lightheadedness following an outpatient treatment for iron deficiency and was released the following day.[119] On November 26, 2014, she had a stent placed in her right coronary artery after experiencing discomfort while exercising in the Supreme Court gym with her personal trainer.[120][121]\nOn November 8, 2018, she was hospitalized after fracturing three ribs in a fall in her office at the Supreme Court.[122] A day later, it was reported that Ginsburg had returned to official judicial work after a day of observation.[123][124] An outpouring of public support followed.[125][126] A CT scan of her ribs following her November 8 fall showed cancerous nodules in her lungs.[127] On December 21, Ginsburg underwent a left-lung lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to remove the nodules.[127] On January 7, 2019, for the first time since joining the Court more than 25 years earlier, Ginsburg missed oral argument while she recuperated.[128] She returned to the Supreme Court on February 15, 2019, to participate in a private conference with other justices in her first appearance at the court since her cancer surgery in December 2018.[129]\nOn August 24, 2019, it was revealed that Ginsburg had recently completed three weeks of focused radiation treatment to ablate a tumor found in her pancreas over the summer.[130] On January 7, 2020, Ginsburg reported that she is cancer free.[131]\nWhen John Paul Stevens retired in 2010, Ginsburg became the oldest justice on the court at age 77.[132] Despite rumors that she would retire because of advancing age, poor health, and the death of her husband,[133][134] she denied she was planning to step down. In an August 2010 interview, Ginsburg stated that her work on the court was helping her cope with the death of her husband.[132] She also expressed a wish to emulate Justice Louis Brandeis' service of nearly 23 years, which she achieved in April 2016.[132][135] She stated she has a new \"model\" to emulate in former colleague Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired at age 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench.[135]\nDuring the presidency of Barack Obama, some progressive lawyers and activists called for Ginsburg to retire so that Obama would be able to appoint a like-minded successor,[136][137][138] particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate.[139] They pointed to Ginsburg's age and past health issues as factors making her longevity uncertain.[137] Ginsburg rejected these pleas.[63] She affirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties.[63] Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.[140]\nAs of October 2019, Ginsburg is the fourth-oldest serving Supreme Court Justice ever, at age 86. [141]\nIn 2002, Ginsburg was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[142] Ginsburg has been named one of 100 Most Powerful Women (2009),[143] one of Glamour magazine's Women of the Year 2012,[144] and one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people (2015).[145] She has been awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees by Willamette University (2009),[146] Princeton University (2010),[147] and Harvard University (2011).[148]\nIn 2013, a painting featuring the four female justices to have served as justices on the Supreme Court (Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan) was unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[149][150]\nResearchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave a species of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a resemblance to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.[151][152]\nGinsberg was the recipient of the 2019 US $1 million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture.[153] Awarded annually, the Berggruen Institute stated it recognizes \"thinkers whose ideas have profoundly shaped human self-understanding and advancement in a rapidly changing world,\"[154] noting Ginsberg as \"a lifelong trailblazer for human rights and gender equality.\"[155]\nIn 2019, the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles created Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a major exhibition focusing on Ginsberg's life and career.[156][157][158][159]\nGinsburg has been referred to as a \"pop culture icon\".[160][161][162] Ginsburg's profile began to rise after O'Connor's retirement in 2006 left Ginsburg as the only serving female justice. Her increasingly fiery dissents, particularly in Shelby County v. Holder 570 U.S. 2 (2013), led to the creation of the Notorious R.B.G. Tumblr and Internet meme comparing the justice to rapper The Notorious B.I.G.[163] The creator of the Notorious R.B.G. Tumblr, then-law student Shana Knizhnik, teamed up with MSNBC reporter Irin Carmon to turn the blog into a book titled Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[164] Released in October 2015, the book became a New York Times bestseller.[165] In 2015, Ginsburg and Scalia, known for their shared love of opera, were fictionalized in Scalia/Ginsburg, an opera by Derrick Wang.[166]\nAdditionally, Ginsburg's pop culture appeal has inspired nail art, Halloween costumes, a bobblehead doll, tattoos, t-shirts, coffee mugs, and a children's coloring book among other things.[164][167][168][169] She appears in both a comic opera and a workout book.[169] Musician Jonathan Mann also made a song using part of her Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. dissent.[170] Ginsburg has admitted to having a \"large supply\" of Notorious R.B.G. t-shirts, which she distributes as gifts.[171]\nSince 2015, Ginsburg has been portrayed by Kate McKinnon on Saturday Night Live.[172] McKinnon has repeatedly reprised the role, including during a Weekend Update sketch that aired from the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.[173][174] The segments typically feature McKinnon-as-Ginsburg lobbing insults she calls \"Ginsburns\" and doing a celebratory dance.[175][176] Filmmakers Betsy West and Julie Cohen created a documentary about Ginsburg, titled RBG, for CNN Films, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.[177][23] In the film Deadpool 2 (2018), a photo of her is shown as Deadpool considers her for his X-Force, a team of superheroes.[178] Another film, On the Basis of Sex, focusing on Ginsburg's career struggles fighting for equal rights, was released later in 2018; its screenplay was named to the Black List of best unproduced screenplays of 2014.[179] English actress Felicity Jones portrays Ginsburg in the film, with Armie Hammer as her husband Marty.[180] Ginsburg herself has a cameo in the film.[181] The seventh season of the sitcom New Girl features a three-year-old character named Ruth Bader Schmidt, named after Ginsburg.[182] A Lego mini-figurine of Ginsburg is shown within a brief segment of The Lego Movie 2. Ginsburg gave her blessing for the cameo, as well as to have the mini-figurine produced as part of the Lego toy sets following the film's release in February 2019.[183] Also in 2019, Samuel Adams released a limited-edition beer called When There Are Nine, referring to Ginsburg's well-known reply to the question about when there would be enough women on the Supreme Court.[184]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\n2020 presidential campaign U.S. Senator from Massachusetts Early political involvement Elizabeth Ann Warren (n\u00e9e Herring; born June 22, 1949) is an American politician and former academic, serving as the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts since 2013. She was formerly a law school professor specializing in bankruptcy law. A member of the Democratic Party and a progressive, Warren has focused on consumer protection, economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren is also a Democratic candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election. Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in the field of commercial law before beginning her political career. She has authored five and coauthored six books. Warren's first foray into public policy began in 1995 when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals. Her national profile grew during the late 2000s following her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the 2007\u201308 financial crisis. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of which she served as the first Special Advisor under President Obama. In November 2012, Warren won the U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, defeating incumbent Republican Scott Brown and becoming the first female Senator from Massachusetts. She was assigned to the Senate Special Committee on Aging; the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Warren won reelection by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl. On February 9, 2019, at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election.[3] Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949.[4][5][6][7] She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (n\u00e9e Reed, 1912\u20131995), a homemaker,[8][9] and Donald Jones Herring (1911\u20131997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II.[10][11] Warren has described her family as teetering \"on the ragged edge of the middle class\" and \"kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails\".[12][13] She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.[14][15] Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City.[13] When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward,[13] had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work.[6] After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building.[16] Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears.[6] When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.[17][18] Warren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16.[6] She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert\u2007\"Jim\" Warren,[2] whom she had met in high school.[6][17][19] Warren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM.[6][20] She enrolled in the University of Houston and graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech pathology and audiology.[16][21] The Warrens moved to New Jersey when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, Amelia.[6][12][22] After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled in Rutgers Law School at Rutgers University\u2013Newark.[22] She received her J.D. in 1976, and passed the bar examination shortly thereafter.[19][22] Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander.[6][12] The Warrens divorced in 1978,[6][12] and two years later, Warren married law professor Bruce H. Mann on July 12, 1980,[23] but kept her first husband's surname.[12][24] Warren has three grandchildren through her daughter Amelia.[25] In 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school, Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school.[26] During law school, Warren worked as a summer associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. After she received her J.D. and passed the bar examination, she decided to offer legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.[19][22] In the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to bankruptcy and middle-class personal finance.[22] She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s. Warren began her academic career as a lecturer at Rutgers University, Newark School of Law (1977\u201378). She then moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978\u201383), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 1987[21] and was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught Sunday school.[14][27] Warren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the Notre Dame Law Review, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted.[28] But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law.[29] According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts.[30] Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book As We Forgive Our Debtors in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as \"worse than disillusionment\" and \"like being shocked at a deep-down level\".[28] In 2004, she published an article in the Washington University Law Review in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy.[31] Warren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at Harvard Law School as Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996 she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not a dean, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876.[32][21] As of 2011[update], she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university.[29] Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and commercial law. From 2005 to 2009 Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields.[33][34] In 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission's chair, former Congressman Mike Synar, asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren's during their school years.[35] She helped draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers' right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed consumers' ability to file for bankruptcy.[17][36] From 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion.[37] She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law,[38] a former vice president of the American Law Institute and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[39] Warren's scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.[40] On November 14, 2008, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appointed Warren to chair the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.[41] The panel released monthly oversight reports evaluating the government bailout and related programs.[42] During Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, AIG, bank stress tests, the impact of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics.[43][44][45] Warren was an early advocate for creating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency.[46] While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, financial institutions and Republican members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator.[17][47][48] Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director,[49] in January 2012, Obama appointed former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray to the post in a recess appointment over Republican senators' objections.[50][51] Friends and colleagues of Warren's from her high school days to the early part of her academic career in the 1980s have characterized her as a \"die-hard conservative\" with a belief in laissez-faire economics and \"surprisingly anti-consumer views\". Gary L. Francione, who had been a colleague of hers at the University of Pennsylvania, recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he \"almost fell off [his] chair... She\u2019s definitely changed\".[28] Warren was registered as a Republican from 1991 to 1996.[1] She voted Republican for many years. \"I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets\", she has said.[6] But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in 1976, for Gerald Ford.[28] Warren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed that neither should dominate.[52] According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.[53][54] On September 14, 2011, Warren declared her intention to run for the Democratic nomination for the 2012 election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate. Republican Scott Brown had won the seat in a 2010 special election after Ted Kennedy's death.[55][56] A week later, a video of Warren speaking in Andover went viral on the Internet.[57] In it, Warren responds to the charge that asking the rich to pay more taxes is \"class warfare\" by saying that no one grew rich in the U.S. without depending on infrastructure paid for by the rest of society:[58][59] There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.\u00a0... You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea. God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is, you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along. President Obama later echoed her sentiments in a 2012 election campaign speech.[60] Warren ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination and won it on June 2, 2012, at the state Democratic convention with a record 95.77% of the votes of delegates.[61][62][63] She encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented that \"no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren\".[64] Warren nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, more than any other Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to The New York Times, \"that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win\".[65] Warren received a prime-time speaking slot at the 2012 Democratic National Convention on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that \"has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered\". According to Warren, \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged.\" Warren said Wall Street CEOs \"wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs\" and that they \"still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them\".[66][67][68] On January 6, 2017, in an email to supporters, Warren announced that she would be running for a second term as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, writing, \"The people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. ... This is no time to quit.\"[69] In the 2018 election Warren defeated Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, 60% to 36%. On November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts,[4] as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 female senators in office, the largest female U.S. Senate delegation in history at the time, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the implementation of Dodd\u2013Frank and other regulation of the banking industry.[70] Vice President Joe Biden swore Warren in on January 3, 2013.[71] At Warren's first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, \"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'.\" Videos of Warren's questioning amassed more than one million views in a matter of days.[72] At a March Banking Committee hearing, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: \"If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail ... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.\"[73] In May 2013, Warren sent letters to the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve questioning their decisions that settling would be more fruitful than going to court.[74] Also in May, saying that students should get \"the same great deal that banks get\", Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%.[75] Independent Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed her bill, saying: \"The only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn't\".[76] During the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. After the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position created for her. The appointment added to speculation that Warren would run for president in 2016.[77][78][79][80] Saying \"despite the progress we've made since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy\", in July 2015 Warren, along with John McCain (R-AZ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Angus King (I-ME) reintroduced the 21st Century Glass\u2013Steagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation was intended to reduce the American taxpayer's risk in the financial system and decrease the likelihood of future financial crises.[81] In a September 20, 2016 hearing, Warren called on Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to resign, adding that he should be \"criminally investigated\" over Wells Fargo's opening of two million checking and credit-card accounts without the customers' consent.[82][83] In December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which The Boston Globe called \"a high-profile perch on one of the chamber's most powerful committees\" that would \"fuel speculation about a possible 2020 bid for president\".[84] During the debate on Senator Jeff Sessions's nomination for United States Attorney General in February 2017, Warren quoted a letter Coretta Scott King had written to Senator Strom Thurmond in 1986 when Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship.[85] King wrote, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.\"[85] Senate Republicans voted that by reading the letter from King, Warren had violated Senate rule 19, which prohibits impugning another senator's character.[85] This prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions's nomination, and Warren instead read King's letter while streaming live online.[86][87] In rebuking Warren, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor, \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\"[87] McConnell's language became a slogan for Warren and others.[87][88] On October 3, 2017, during Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy J. Sloan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Warren called on him to resign, saying, \"At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.\"[89] On July 17, 2019, Warren and Rep. AI Lawson introduced legislation that would make low-income college students eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) according to The College Student Hunger Act of 2019.[90] In the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, supporters put Warren forward as a possible presidential candidate, but she repeatedly said she would not run for president in 2016.[91][92][93][94] In October 2013, she joined the other 15 female Democratic senators in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run.[95] There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate.[96][97] On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted.[98] On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person short list to be Clinton's running mate.[98][99] Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine. Until her June endorsement, Warren was neutral during the Democratic primary but made public statements that she was cheering Bernie Sanders on.[100] In June, Warren endorsed and campaigned for Clinton before Sanders endorsed Clinton.[101] She called Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, dishonest, uncaring, and \"a loser\".[102][103][104] At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on September 29, 2018, Warren said she would \"take a hard look\" at running for president in the 2020 election after the 2018 United States elections concluded.[105] On December 31, 2018, Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee to run for president.[106][107] On February 9, 2019, Warren officially announced her candidacy at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike.[108] A longtime critic of President Trump, Warren called him a \"symptom of a larger problem [that has resulted in] a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else\".[109] Warren staged her first campaign event in Lawrence to demonstrate the constituency groups she hopes to appeal to, including working class families, union members, women, and new immigrants. She called for major changes in government: It won't be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration. We can't afford to just tinker around the edges\u2014a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change. This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone.[3] In August 2019, The New York Times ran a story saying that Warren \"is signaling to party leaders that, far from wanting to stage a 'political revolution' in the fashion of Mr. Sanders, she wants to revive the beleaguered Democratic National Committee and help recapture the Senate while retaining the House in 2020\".[110] In early June 2019, Warren placed second in some polls, with Joe Biden in first place and Bernie Sanders in third.[111] In the following weeks her poll numbers steadily increased, and a September Iowa poll placed her in the lead with 22% to Biden's 20%. The Iowa poll also rated the number of voters at least considering voting for each candidate; Warren scored 71% to Biden's 60%. Poll respondents also gave her a higher \"enthusiasm\" rating, with 32% of her backers extremely enthusiastic to Biden's 22%.[112] An October 24 Quinnipiac poll placed Warren in the lead at 28%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 15%. When asked which candidate had the best policy ideas, 30% of respondents named Warren, with Sanders at 20% and Biden 15%. Sanders was most often named as the candidate who \"cares most about people like you,\" with Warren in second place and Biden third. Sanders also placed first at 28% when respondents were asked which candidate was the most honest, followed by Warren and Biden at 15% each.[113] Warren and Bernie Sanders are the only leading 2020 candidates who are running their campaigns entirely on grassroots cash. The Los Angeles Times reported that of the front-runners in the presidential race, only Sanders and Warren have previously won an election with almost exclusively small online contributions, and that no presidential primary in recent history has had two of the top three candidates refuse to use bundlers or hold private fundraisers with wealthy donors. Noting Sanders's and Warren's willingness to appear at events not sponsored by potential wealthy donors, the Times wrote that of all the candidates invited to an African American church-based presidential forum in Atlanta, only Sanders and Warren attended; the others reported \"scheduling conflicts\".[114] In October 2019, Warren announced that her campaign would not accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at banks, large tech companies, private equity firms, or hedge funds, in addition to her previous refusal to accept donations of over $200 from fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.[115] In the third quarter of 2019 Warren's campaign raised $24.6 million, just less than the $25.3 million Sanders's campaign raised and well ahead of Joe Biden, the front-runner in the polls, who raised $15.2 million. Warren\u2019s average donation was $26; Sanders's was $18.[116] As of September 2019, Warren had attended 128 town halls. She is known for remaining afterward to talk with audience members and for the large numbers of selfies she has taken with them.[114] On September 17, over 20,000 people attended a Warren rally at New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park. After her speech long lines formed, and people waited up to four hours for selfies.[117] Due to the ongoing impeachment trial, Warren was unable to make final campaign stops in person and opted to send her dog, Bailey Warren, to meet with voters in Iowa.[118] In 2012, the UK magazine New Statesman named Warren among the \"top 20 US progressives\".[120] Since announcing her candidacy in the 2020 presidential election, Warren has released several policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, and plans to address opioid addiction. She has introduced an \"Economic Patriotism\" plan intended to create opportunities for American workers, and proposals inspired by opposition to President Trump, including one that would make it permissible to indict a sitting president.[111] Warren supports worker representation on corporations' board of directors, breaking up monopolies, stiffening sentences for white-collar crime, a Medicare-for-all plan to provide health insurance for all Americans, and a higher minimum wage.[121] Warren has become known for the number and depth of her policy proposals, leading to the phrase \"Warren has a plan for that\" becoming an internet meme.[122] On her website, she lists more than 45 plans for topics including health care, universal child care, ending the opioid crisis, clean energy, climate change, foreign policy, reducing corporate influence at the Pentagon, and ending \"Wall Street's stranglehold on [the American] economy\".[123] Warren has been highly critical of the Trump administration. She has expressed concerns over what she says are Trump's conflicts of interest. The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, written by Warren, was first read in the Senate in January 2017.[124][125] In November 2018 Warren said she would not vote for Trump's United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA): \"It won't stop outsourcing, it won't raise wages, and it won't create jobs. It's NAFTA 2.0.\" She has also said she believes USMCA would make it harder to reduce drug prices because it would allow drug companies to lock in the prices they charge for many drugs.[126] Warren has been highly critical of Trump's immigration policies. In 2018 she called for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[127] Warren has criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in support of Yemen's government against the Houthis.[128][129] In January 2019, Warren criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She agreed that US troops should be withdrawn from Syria and Afghanistan but said such withdrawals should be part of a \"coordinated\" plan formed with US allies.[130] In April 2019, after reading the Mueller Report, Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying, \"The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.\"[131] According to Warren and her brothers, older family members told them during their childhood that they had Native American ancestry.[132][133] In 2012, she said that \"being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born\".[134] In 1984,[135][136] Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified herself as Cherokee.[137][138] The Washington Post reported that in 1986, Warren identified her race as \"American Indian\" on a State Bar of Texas write-in form used for statistical information gathering, but added that there was \"no indication it was used for professional advancement\".[139] A comprehensive Boston Globe investigation concluded that her reported ethnicity played no role in her rise in the academic legal profession.[140] In February 2019, Warren apologized for having identified as Native American.[138][141][142] During Warren's first Senate race in 2012, her opponent, Scott Brown, speculated that she had fabricated Native ancestry to gain advantage on the employment market and used Warren's ancestry in several attack ads.[143][144][145] Warren has denied that her heritage gave her any advantages in her schooling or her career.[146] Several colleagues and employers (including Harvard) have said her reported ethnic status played no role in her hiring.[147][148] From 1995 to 2004, her employer, Harvard Law School, listed her as a Native American in its federal affirmative action forms; Warren later said she was unaware of this.[149] A 2018 Boston Globe investigation found \"clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools\" and that \"Warren was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed her\".[140] President Donald Trump has \"persistently mocked\" Warren for her assertions of Native American ancestry.[150] At a July 2018 Montana rally, Trump promised that if he debated Warren, he would offer to pay $1\u00a0million to her favorite charity if she could prove her Native American ancestry via a DNA test. Warren released results of a DNA test in October 2018, then asked Trump to donate the money to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. Trump responded by denying that he had made the challenge.[151][152] The DNA test found that Warren's ancestry is mostly European but \"strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor\", likely \"in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago.\"[153] The Cherokee Nation criticized the use of DNA testing to determine Native American heritage as \"inappropriate and wrong\".[148][154] According to Politico, \"Warren's past claims of American Indian ancestry garnered fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle, with President Donald Trump labeling her with a slur, \u201cPocahontas\u201d, and tribal leaders calling out Warren for claiming a heritage she did not culturally belong to.\"[155] During a January 2019 public appearance in Sioux City, Iowa, Warren was asked by an attendee, \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald more fodder to be a bully?\" Warren responded in part, \"I am not a person of color; I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\"[156] She later reached out to leadership of the Cherokee Nation to apologize \"for furthering confusion over issues of tribal sovereignty and citizenship and for any harm her announcement caused\". Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said that Warren understands \"that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests.\"[157] In mid-February 2019, Warren received a standing ovation during a surprise visit to a Native American conference, where she was introduced by freshman Representative Deb Haaland (D-NM), one of the first two Native American women elected to the US Congress.[158][159] Haaland endorsed Warren for president in July 2019, calling her \"a great partner for Indian Country\".[160] In 2009 The Boston Globe named Warren the Bostonian of the Year[16] and the Women's Bar Association of Massachusetts honored her with the Lelia J. Robinson Award.[161] She was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2009, 2010 and 2015.[162][163][164][165] The National Law Journal has repeatedly named Warren one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America,[166][167] and in 2010 named her one of the 40 most influential attorneys of the decade.[168] In 2011 Warren was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.[169] In January 2012 New Statesman magazine named her one of the \"top 20 US progressives\".[120] In 2009 Warren became the first professor in Harvard's history to win the law school's Sacks\u2013Freund Teaching Award for a second time.[170] In 2011 she delivered the commencement address at the Rutgers Law School in Newark, her alma mater, and obtained an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and membership in the Order of the Coif.[171] In 2018 the Women's History Month theme in the United States was \"Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination against Women\", referring to McConnell's remark about Warren.[172] In 2004, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.[183] In an article in The New York Times, Jeff Madrick said of the book: The authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children\u00a0... their main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care, and neighborhoods required to be middle class today. More clearly than anyone else, I think, Ms. Warren and Ms. Tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live.[184] In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills[185] that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance.[186] The study was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged its methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.[187] Metropolitan Books published Warren's book A Fighting Chance in April 2014.[188] According to a Boston Globe review, \"the book's title refers to a time she says is now gone, when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by the rules had at a fair shot at the American dream.\"[189] In April 2017, Warren published her 11th book,[190] This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class, in which she explores the plight of the American middle class and argues that the federal government needs to do more to help working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education.[191]",

She was formerly a law school professor specializing in bankruptcy law. A member of the Democratic Party and a progressive, Warren has focused on consumer protection, economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren is also a Democratic candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election.\nWarren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in the field of commercial law before beginning her political career. She has authored five and coauthored six books.\nWarren's first foray into public policy began in 1995 when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals. Her national profile grew during the late 2000s following her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the 2007\u201308 financial crisis. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of which she served as the first Special Advisor under President Obama.\nIn November 2012, Warren won the U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, defeating incumbent Republican Scott Brown and becoming the first female Senator from Massachusetts. She was assigned to the Senate Special Committee on Aging; the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Warren won reelection by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl. On February 9, 2019, at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election.[3]\nWarren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949.[4][5][6][7] She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (n\u00e9e Reed, 1912\u20131995), a homemaker,[8][9] and Donald Jones Herring (1911\u20131997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II.[10][11] Warren has described her family as teetering \"on the ragged edge of the middle class\" and \"kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails\".[12][13] She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.[14][15]\nWarren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City.[13] When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward,[13] had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work.[6] After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building.[16] Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears.[6] When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.[17][18]\nWarren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16.[6] She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert\u2007\"Jim\" Warren,[2] whom she had met in high school.[6][17][19]\nWarren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM.[6][20] She enrolled in the University of Houston and graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech pathology and audiology.[16][21]\nThe Warrens moved to New Jersey when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, Amelia.[6][12][22] After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled in Rutgers Law School at Rutgers University\u2013Newark.[22] She received her J.D. in 1976, and passed the bar examination shortly thereafter.[19][22] Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander.[6][12]\nThe Warrens divorced in 1978,[6][12] and two years later, Warren married law professor Bruce H. Mann on July 12, 1980,[23] but kept her first husband's surname.[12][24] Warren has three grandchildren through her daughter Amelia.[25]\nIn 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school, Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school.[26]\nDuring law school, Warren worked as a summer associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. After she received her J.D. and passed the bar examination, she decided to offer legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.[19][22]\nIn the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to bankruptcy and middle-class personal finance.[22] She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s.\nWarren began her academic career as a lecturer at Rutgers University, Newark School of Law (1977\u201378). She then moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978\u201383), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 1987[21] and was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught Sunday school.[14][27]\nWarren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the Notre Dame Law Review, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted.[28] But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law.[29] According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts.[30] Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book As We Forgive Our Debtors in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as \"worse than disillusionment\" and \"like being shocked at a deep-down level\".[28] In 2004, she published an article in the Washington University Law Review in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy.[31]\nWarren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at Harvard Law School as Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996 she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not a dean, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876.[32][21] As of 2011[update], she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university.[29] Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and commercial law. From 2005 to 2009 Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields.[33][34]\nIn 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission's chair, former Congressman Mike Synar, asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren's during their school years.[35] She helped draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers' right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed consumers' ability to file for bankruptcy.[17][36]\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion.[37] She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law,[38] a former vice president of the American Law Institute and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[39]\nWarren's scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.[40]\nOn November 14, 2008, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appointed Warren to chair the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.[41] The panel released monthly oversight reports evaluating the government bailout and related programs.[42] During Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, AIG, bank stress tests, the impact of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics.[43][44][45]\nWarren was an early advocate for creating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency.[46] While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, financial institutions and Republican members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator.[17][47][48] Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director,[49] in January 2012, Obama appointed former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray to the post in a recess appointment over Republican senators' objections.[50][51]\nFriends and colleagues of Warren's from her high school days to the early part of her academic career in the 1980s have characterized her as a \"die-hard conservative\" with a belief in laissez-faire economics and \"surprisingly anti-consumer views\". Gary L. Francione, who had been a colleague of hers at the University of Pennsylvania, recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he \"almost fell off [his] chair... She\u2019s definitely changed\".[28] Warren was registered as a Republican from 1991 to 1996.[1] She voted Republican for many years. \"I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets\", she has said.[6] But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in 1976, for Gerald Ford.[28] Warren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed that neither should dominate.[52] According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.[53][54]\nOn September 14, 2011, Warren declared her intention to run for the Democratic nomination for the 2012 election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate. Republican Scott Brown had won the seat in a 2010 special election after Ted Kennedy's death.[55][56] A week later, a video of Warren speaking in Andover went viral on the Internet.[57] In it, Warren responds to the charge that asking the rich to pay more taxes is \"class warfare\" by saying that no one grew rich in the U.S. without depending on infrastructure paid for by the rest of society:[58][59]\nThere is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.\u00a0... You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea. God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is, you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.\nPresident Obama later echoed her sentiments in a 2012 election campaign speech.[60]\nWarren ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination and won it on June 2, 2012, at the state Democratic convention with a record 95.77% of the votes of delegates.[61][62][63] She encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented that \"no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren\".[64] Warren nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, more than any other Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to The New York Times, \"that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win\".[65]\nWarren received a prime-time speaking slot at the 2012 Democratic National Convention on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that \"has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered\". According to Warren, \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged.\" Warren said Wall Street CEOs \"wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs\" and that they \"still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them\".[66][67][68]\nOn January 6, 2017, in an email to supporters, Warren announced that she would be running for a second term as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, writing, \"The people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. ... This is no time to quit.\"[69]\nIn the 2018 election Warren defeated Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, 60% to 36%.\nOn November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts,[4] as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 female senators in office, the largest female U.S. Senate delegation in history at the time, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the implementation of Dodd\u2013Frank and other regulation of the banking industry.[70] Vice President Joe Biden swore Warren in on January 3, 2013.[71]\nAt Warren's first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, \"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'.\" Videos of Warren's questioning amassed more than one million views in a matter of days.[72] At a March Banking Committee hearing, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: \"If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail ... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.\"[73]\nIn May 2013, Warren sent letters to the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve questioning their decisions that settling would be more fruitful than going to court.[74] Also in May, saying that students should get \"the same great deal that banks get\", Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%.[75] Independent Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed her bill, saying: \"The only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn't\".[76]\nDuring the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. After the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position created for her. The appointment added to speculation that Warren would run for president in 2016.[77][78][79][80]\nSaying \"despite the progress we've made since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy\", in July 2015 Warren, along with John McCain (R-AZ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Angus King (I-ME) reintroduced the 21st Century Glass\u2013Steagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation was intended to reduce the American taxpayer's risk in the financial system and decrease the likelihood of future financial crises.[81]\nIn a September 20, 2016 hearing, Warren called on Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to resign, adding that he should be \"criminally investigated\" over Wells Fargo's opening of two million checking and credit-card accounts without the customers' consent.[82][83]\nIn December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which The Boston Globe called \"a high-profile perch on one of the chamber's most powerful committees\" that would \"fuel speculation about a possible 2020 bid for president\".[84]\nDuring the debate on Senator Jeff Sessions's nomination for United States Attorney General in February 2017, Warren quoted a letter Coretta Scott King had written to Senator Strom Thurmond in 1986 when Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship.[85] King wrote, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.\"[85] Senate Republicans voted that by reading the letter from King, Warren had violated Senate rule 19, which prohibits impugning another senator's character.[85] This prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions's nomination, and Warren instead read King's letter while streaming live online.[86][87] In rebuking Warren, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor, \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\"[87] McConnell's language became a slogan for Warren and others.[87][88]\nOn October 3, 2017, during Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy J. Sloan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Warren called on him to resign, saying, \"At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.\"[89]\nOn July 17, 2019, Warren and Rep. AI Lawson introduced legislation that would make low-income college students eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) according to The College Student Hunger Act of 2019.[90]\nIn the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, supporters put Warren forward as a possible presidential candidate, but she repeatedly said she would not run for president in 2016.[91][92][93][94] In October 2013, she joined the other 15 female Democratic senators in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run.[95] There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate.[96][97] On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted.[98] On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person short list to be Clinton's running mate.[98][99] Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.\nUntil her June endorsement, Warren was neutral during the Democratic primary but made public statements that she was cheering Bernie Sanders on.[100] In June, Warren endorsed and campaigned for Clinton before Sanders endorsed Clinton.[101] She called Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, dishonest, uncaring, and \"a loser\".[102][103][104]\nAt a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on September 29, 2018, Warren said she would \"take a hard look\" at running for president in the 2020 election after the 2018 United States elections concluded.[105] On December 31, 2018, Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee to run for president.[106][107]\nOn February 9, 2019, Warren officially announced her candidacy at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike.[108] A longtime critic of President Trump, Warren called him a \"symptom of a larger problem [that has resulted in] a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else\".[109]\nWarren staged her first campaign event in Lawrence to demonstrate the constituency groups she hopes to appeal to, including working class families, union members, women, and new immigrants. She called for major changes in government:\nIt won't be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration. We can't afford to just tinker around the edges\u2014a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change. This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone.[3]\nIn August 2019, The New York Times ran a story saying that Warren \"is signaling to party leaders that, far from wanting to stage a 'political revolution' in the fashion of Mr. Sanders, she wants to revive the beleaguered Democratic National Committee and help recapture the Senate while retaining the House in 2020\".[110]\nIn early June 2019, Warren placed second in some polls, with Joe Biden in first place and Bernie Sanders in third.[111] In the following weeks her poll numbers steadily increased, and a September Iowa poll placed her in the lead with 22% to Biden's 20%. The Iowa poll also rated the number of voters at least considering voting for each candidate; Warren scored 71% to Biden's 60%. Poll respondents also gave her a higher \"enthusiasm\" rating, with 32% of her backers extremely enthusiastic to Biden's 22%.[112]\nAn October 24 Quinnipiac poll placed Warren in the lead at 28%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 15%. When asked which candidate had the best policy ideas, 30% of respondents named Warren, with Sanders at 20% and Biden 15%. Sanders was most often named as the candidate who \"cares most about people like you,\" with Warren in second place and Biden third. Sanders also placed first at 28% when respondents were asked which candidate was the most honest, followed by Warren and Biden at 15% each.[113]\nWarren and Bernie Sanders are the only leading 2020 candidates who are running their campaigns entirely on grassroots cash. The Los Angeles Times reported that of the front-runners in the presidential race, only Sanders and Warren have previously won an election with almost exclusively small online contributions, and that no presidential primary in recent history has had two of the top three candidates refuse to use bundlers or hold private fundraisers with wealthy donors. Noting Sanders's and Warren's willingness to appear at events not sponsored by potential wealthy donors, the Times wrote that of all the candidates invited to an African American church-based presidential forum in Atlanta, only Sanders and Warren attended; the others reported \"scheduling conflicts\".[114]\nIn October 2019, Warren announced that her campaign would not accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at banks, large tech companies, private equity firms, or hedge funds, in addition to her previous refusal to accept donations of over $200 from fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.[115]\nIn the third quarter of 2019 Warren's campaign raised $24.6 million, just less than the $25.3 million Sanders's campaign raised and well ahead of Joe Biden, the front-runner in the polls, who raised $15.2 million. Warren\u2019s average donation was $26; Sanders's was $18.[116]\nAs of September 2019, Warren had attended 128 town halls. She is known for remaining afterward to talk with audience members and for the large numbers of selfies she has taken with them.[114] On September 17, over 20,000 people attended a Warren rally at New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park. After her speech long lines formed, and people waited up to four hours for selfies.[117]\nDue to the ongoing impeachment trial, Warren was unable to make final campaign stops in person and opted to send her dog, Bailey Warren, to meet with voters in Iowa.[118]\nIn 2012, the UK magazine New Statesman named Warren among the \"top 20 US progressives\".[120]\nSince announcing her candidacy in the 2020 presidential election, Warren has released several policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, and plans to address opioid addiction. She has introduced an \"Economic Patriotism\" plan intended to create opportunities for American workers, and proposals inspired by opposition to President Trump, including one that would make it permissible to indict a sitting president.[111] Warren supports worker representation on corporations' board of directors, breaking up monopolies, stiffening sentences for white-collar crime, a Medicare-for-all plan to provide health insurance for all Americans, and a higher minimum wage.[121]\nWarren has become known for the number and depth of her policy proposals, leading to the phrase \"Warren has a plan for that\" becoming an internet meme.[122] On her website, she lists more than 45 plans for topics including health care, universal child care, ending the opioid crisis, clean energy, climate change, foreign policy, reducing corporate influence at the Pentagon, and ending \"Wall Street's stranglehold on [the American] economy\".[123]\nWarren has been highly critical of the Trump administration. She has expressed concerns over what she says are Trump's conflicts of interest. The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, written by Warren, was first read in the Senate in January 2017.[124][125] In November 2018 Warren said she would not vote for Trump's United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA): \"It won't stop outsourcing, it won't raise wages, and it won't create jobs. It's NAFTA 2.0.\" She has also said she believes USMCA would make it harder to reduce drug prices because it would allow drug companies to lock in the prices they charge for many drugs.[126] Warren has been highly critical of Trump's immigration policies. In 2018 she called for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[127] Warren has criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in support of Yemen's government against the Houthis.[128][129]\nIn January 2019, Warren criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She agreed that US troops should be withdrawn from Syria and Afghanistan but said such withdrawals should be part of a \"coordinated\" plan formed with US allies.[130] In April 2019, after reading the Mueller Report, Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying, \"The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.\"[131]\nAccording to Warren and her brothers, older family members told them during their childhood that they had Native American ancestry.[132][133] In 2012, she said that \"being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born\".[134] In 1984,[135][136] Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified herself as Cherokee.[137][138] The Washington Post reported that in 1986, Warren identified her race as \"American Indian\" on a State Bar of Texas write-in form used for statistical information gathering, but added that there was \"no indication it was used for professional advancement\".[139] A comprehensive Boston Globe investigation concluded that her reported ethnicity played no role in her rise in the academic legal profession.[140] In February 2019, Warren apologized for having identified as Native American.[138][141][142]\nDuring Warren's first Senate race in 2012, her opponent, Scott Brown, speculated that she had fabricated Native ancestry to gain advantage on the employment market and used Warren's ancestry in several attack ads.[143][144][145] Warren has denied that her heritage gave her any advantages in her schooling or her career.[146] Several colleagues and employers (including Harvard) have said her reported ethnic status played no role in her hiring.[147][148] From 1995 to 2004, her employer, Harvard Law School, listed her as a Native American in its federal affirmative action forms; Warren later said she was unaware of this.[149] A 2018 Boston Globe investigation found \"clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools\" and that \"Warren was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed her\".[140]\nPresident Donald Trump has \"persistently mocked\" Warren for her assertions of Native American ancestry.[150] At a July 2018 Montana rally, Trump promised that if he debated Warren, he would offer to pay $1\u00a0million to her favorite charity if she could prove her Native American ancestry via a DNA test. Warren released results of a DNA test in October 2018, then asked Trump to donate the money to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. Trump responded by denying that he had made the challenge.[151][152] The DNA test found that Warren's ancestry is mostly European but \"strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor\", likely \"in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago.\"[153] The Cherokee Nation criticized the use of DNA testing to determine Native American heritage as \"inappropriate and wrong\".[148][154] According to Politico, \"Warren's past claims of American Indian ancestry garnered fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle, with President Donald Trump labeling her with a slur, \u201cPocahontas\u201d, and tribal leaders calling out Warren for claiming a heritage she did not culturally belong to.\"[155]\nDuring a January 2019 public appearance in Sioux City, Iowa, Warren was asked by an attendee, \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald more fodder to be a bully?\" Warren responded in part, \"I am not a person of color; I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\"[156] She later reached out to leadership of the Cherokee Nation to apologize \"for furthering confusion over issues of tribal sovereignty and citizenship and for any harm her announcement caused\". Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said that Warren understands \"that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests.\"[157]\nIn mid-February 2019, Warren received a standing ovation during a surprise visit to a Native American conference, where she was introduced by freshman Representative Deb Haaland (D-NM), one of the first two Native American women elected to the US Congress.[158][159] Haaland endorsed Warren for president in July 2019, calling her \"a great partner for Indian Country\".[160]\nIn 2009 The Boston Globe named Warren the Bostonian of the Year[16] and the Women's Bar Association of Massachusetts honored her with the Lelia J. Robinson Award.[161] She was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2009, 2010 and 2015.[162][163][164][165] The National Law Journal has repeatedly named Warren one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America,[166][167] and in 2010 named her one of the 40 most influential attorneys of the decade.[168] In 2011 Warren was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.[169] In January 2012 New Statesman magazine named her one of the \"top 20 US progressives\".[120]\nIn 2009 Warren became the first professor in Harvard's history to win the law school's Sacks\u2013Freund Teaching Award for a second time.[170] In 2011 she delivered the commencement address at the Rutgers Law School in Newark, her alma mater, and obtained an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and membership in the Order of the Coif.[171]\nIn 2018 the Women's History Month theme in the United States was \"Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination against Women\", referring to McConnell's remark about Warren.[172]\nIn 2004, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.[183]\nIn an article in The New York Times, Jeff Madrick said of the book:\nThe authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children\u00a0... their main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care, and neighborhoods required to be middle class today. More clearly than anyone else, I think, Ms. Warren and Ms. Tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live.[184]\nIn 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills[185] that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance.[186] The study was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged its methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.[187]\nMetropolitan Books published Warren's book A Fighting Chance in April 2014.[188] According to a Boston Globe review, \"the book's title refers to a time she says is now gone, when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by the rules had at a fair shot at the American dream.\"[189]\nIn April 2017, Warren published her 11th book,[190] This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class, in which she explores the plight of the American middle class and argues that the federal government needs to do more to help working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education.[191]\n\n\n</body></html>"

Her first name is derived from Arabic \u0623\u0645\u0644 \u02beamal, meaning \"hope\".[8] Her family left Lebanon when she was two years old, during the Lebanese Civil War, and settled in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.[9] Her father, Ramzi Alamuddin, a Lebanese Druze from Baakline (a village in the Chouf district),[10] received his MBA degree at the American University of Beirut. He returned to Lebanon in 1991.[11][12] Her mother, Bariaa (n\u00e9e Miknass), from a family of Sunni Muslims[13][10] from Tripoli in Northern Lebanon,[13][10] is a political journalist[14] and foreign editor of the Pan-Arab newspaper al-Hayat and a founder of the public relations company International Communication Experts, which is part of a larger company that specialises in celebrity guest bookings, publicity photography, and event promotion.[15] Alamuddin has three siblings: one sister and two half-brothers,[15] from her father's first marriage.[16] Alamuddin attended Dr Challoner's High School, a girls' grammar school located in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire. She then studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she received an Exhibition[17] and the Shrigley Award.[18] In 2000, Clooney graduated with a BA degree in Jurisprudence (Oxford's equivalent to the LLB).[19] The following year, in 2001, she entered New York University School of Law to study for the LLM degree. She received the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law.[20][21] For one semester while at NYU, she worked in the office of Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[22] Clooney is qualified to practice as a lawyer in the United States and the United Kingdom. She was admitted to the bar in New York in 2002, and in England and Wales in 2010. She has also practised at international courts in The Hague including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.[20] Alamuddin worked at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York City, for three years as part of the Criminal Defense and Investigations Group, where her clients included Enron and Arthur Andersen.[18][20] In 2004, she completed a judicial clerkship at the International Court of Justice. She clerked under Judge Vladlen S. Vereshchetin from Russia, Judge Nabil Elaraby from Egypt,[23][24] and ad hoc Judge Sir Franklin Berman from the United Kingdom. She was subsequently based in The Hague working in the Office of the Prosecutor at the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon and at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.[25] Alamuddin returned to Britain in 2010,[26] where she became a barrister in London (Bar of England & Wales, Inner Temple) at Doughty Street Chambers.[18] In 2013 Clooney was appointed to a number of United Nations commissions, including as adviser to Special Envoy Kofi Annan on Syria and as Counsel to the 2013 Drone Inquiry by UN human rights rapporteur Ben Emmerson QC into the use of drones in counter-terrorism operations.[21][27] Alamuddin had been involved in high-profile cases representing the state of Cambodia, the former Libyan intelligence chief Abdallah Al Senussi, Yulia Tymoshenko[28] and Julian Assange, and was an adviser to the King of Bahrain in connection with the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry headed by Professor M. Cherif Bassiouni.[20] For the spring 2015 and 2016 academic semesters, Clooney was a visiting faculty member and a senior fellow with Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute.[29][30] She was a co-professor with Sarah H. Cleveland in Cleveland's course on human rights and taught a class on human rights litigation to students in the school's Human Rights Clinic.[31][32] For the spring 2018 semester, Clooney taught at Columbia Law School, again as a co-professor with Sarah H. Cleveland on a core class on human rights.[33] Clooney has also lectured students on international criminal law at the Law School of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, The New School in New York City, The Hague Academy of International Law, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.[20] As of 2011[update], Alamuddin was assisting the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the arbitration between Merck Sharp and Dohme and the Republic of Ecuador.[34] Starting in 2014, Clooney represented Canadian Al Jazeera English journalist Mohamed Fahmy who, along with other journalists, was being held in Egypt.[35][36][37][38] He was eventually sentenced to three years in prison and lost a retrial in August 2015 before finally being pardoned by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.[39][40] In August 2014, Clooney declined a UN commission to look into possible violations of the rules of war in Gaza during the Gaza war of 2014.[41] In October 2014, Clooney was hired in an attempt to repatriate the ancient Greek sculptures the Elgin Marbles.[42][43] In May 2015, Greece decided to stop legal proceedings to recover the sculptures and dismissed her as their brief.[44] In January 2015, Clooney began work on the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[45] She is representing Armenia on behalf of Doughty Street Chambers along with Geoffrey Robertson QC.[46] She said Turkey's stance was hypocritical \"because of its disgraceful record on freedom of expression\", including prosecutions of Turkish-Armenians who campaigned for the 1915 massacres to be called a genocide.[45] She is representing Armenia in the case against Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek,[47][48] whose 2007 conviction for genocide denial and racial discrimination was overturned in Perin\u00e7ek v. Switzerland (2013).[45] A \"minor internet frenzy\" resulted from her bon mot prior to the 28 January 2015 hearing. In response to a journalist pestering her over what designer gown she would be wearing in court, she replied \"Ede & Ravenscroft\"\u00a0\u2013 the tailors who make her court robes.[49][50] On 8 March 2015, Clooney filed a case against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines before the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, a body under the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, for the continued detention of former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.[51] Arroyo was a sitting Pampanga congresswoman at the time. On 2 October, The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention later released its opinion that the detention of former President Arroyo \"violates international law\" and is \"arbitrary on a number of grounds\".[52] On 7 April 2015, it was announced that Clooney would be part of the legal team defending Mohamed Nasheed, former President of the Maldives, in his ongoing arbitrary detention.[53] Nasheed was sentenced to 13 years in jail in March 2015 following what was characterized as a politically motivated trial.[54] Amnesty International described his sentencing as a \"travesty of justice\".[55][56] Prior to visiting the Maldives, the local co-counsel working on the case was stabbed in the head, an indication of the danger and instability in the country.[57] In January 2016, Clooney gave a series of interviews about the UN-condemned trial and imprisonment of Nasheed and put forth efforts to support imposing sanctions on the Maldives.[58][59] According to The Economist, she has \"helped strengthen the backing of Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, for the cause of Maldivian democracy.\"[60] In June 2015, Clooney began work on the recently re-opened Hooded Men case[61] brought by the Irish government against the British government in the European Court of Human Rights.[62][63] Clooney worked with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Charles Flanagan[citation needed] on the case, which concerned policies used by UK Prime Minister Edward Heath (1970\u20131974) in Operation Demetrius that included the illegal interrogation methods known as five techniques.[64] In September 2018, the court rejected the final appeal in the case.[65] Clooney is part of the legal team representing Louis Olivier Bancoult and Chagos islanders on their claim[66] that they had been forced off their island, Diego Garcia, in 1971 by the UK government to make way for a U.S. military base.[67] In 2016, it was announced that Clooney would represent Azerbaijani journalist Khadija Ismayilova at the European Court of Human Rights. Ismayilova's investigative work had resulted in her imprisonment.[68] Following the trial, Ismayilova was released from prison and had her sentence reduced to a suspended three-and-a-half-year term.[69] In September 2016, Clooney spoke\u00a0\u2013 for the first time at the United Nations\u00a0\u2013 before the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to discuss the decision she made in June 2016[70] to represent Nadia Murad as a client in legal action against ISIL commanders.[71][72][73] Clooney characterised the genocide, rape, and trafficking as a \"bureaucracy of evil on an industrial scale\" by ISIL, describing a slave market existing both online, on Facebook and in the Middle East that is still active today.[74] Clooney, along with Ara Darzi, was involved in securing the release of two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, from Myanmar on 7 May 2019.[75] On 25 February 2014, the UK Attorney General's Office appointed Clooney for the period 2014 to 2019 to the C Panel of the Public International Law Panel of Counsel.[76][77] In May 2014, Clooney was a signatory of UNICEF UK and Jemima Khan's open letter that called for \"action from UK Government to protect women and children\".[78] On 2 January 2015, it was reported by The Guardian that before Clooney was involved as Rapporteur in the case against Mohamed Fahmy, she had written a report in February 2014 for the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) that was critical of Egypt's judiciary process. Clooney and others were warned that there was a strong possibility they would be arrested if they entered Egypt, as a result of the criticism.[79][80] In April 2019, Clooney became a special envoy at the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, advising the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt on global media freedom.[7][81] In her role as media freedom special envoy, Clooney will chair a panel of international lawyers to 'develop and promote legal mechanisms to prevent and reverse media abuses'.[82] Clooney studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she received an Exhibition[17] and the Shrigley Award.[18] Clooney received the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law from NYU School of Law.[20][21] Clooney was chosen as Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2015.[83] At the 2014 British Fashion Awards, Clooney was shortlisted for Best British Style alongside David Beckham, Kate Moss, Keira Knightley and Emma Watson.[84] Clooney is the president of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which she co-founded with her husband George Clooney in late 2016 to advance justice in courtrooms, communities, and classrooms around the world. Clooney partnered with the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative in beginning the Amal Clooney Scholarship, which was created to send one female student from Lebanon to the United World College Dilijan each year, to enroll in a two-year International Baccalaureate (IB) programme.[85] Clooney and her husband sponsor a Yazidi student, Hazim Avdal, who Clooney met via her work with Nadia Murad as Avdal worked at Yazda. He is attending the University of Chicago.[86] In 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the Clooneys pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives and said they would be in attendance.[87] Clooney is fluent in English, French, and Arabic.[88][89] She became engaged to actor George Clooney on 28 April 2014.[90] They had first met through a mutual friend in July 2013.[91] On 7 August 2014, the couple obtained marriage licences in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London.[92] They married on 27 September 2014 in Venice's city hall (at Ca' Farsetti),[93][94][95] following a high-profile wedding ceremony two days earlier, also[96] in Venice.[97][98][99] They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, former mayor of Rome.[99][100] The wedding was widely reported in the media.[101] In October 2014, it was announced that the Clooneys had bought the Mill House on an island in the River Thames at Sonning Eye in England[102] at a cost of around \u00a310 million.[103] In February 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show The Talk that Clooney was pregnant.[104] Friend Matt Damon confirmed the pregnancy to Entertainment Tonight.[105] In June 2017, she gave birth to fraternal twins.[106]",

Her first name is derived from Arabic \u0623\u0645\u0644 \u02beamal, meaning \"hope\".[8]\nHer family left Lebanon when she was two years old, during the Lebanese Civil War, and settled in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.[9] Her father, Ramzi Alamuddin, a Lebanese Druze from Baakline (a village in the Chouf district),[10] received his MBA degree at the American University of Beirut. He returned to Lebanon in 1991.[11][12] Her mother, Bariaa (n\u00e9e Miknass), from a family of Sunni Muslims[13][10] from Tripoli in Northern Lebanon,[13][10] is a political journalist[14] and foreign editor of the Pan-Arab newspaper al-Hayat and a founder of the public relations company International Communication Experts, which is part of a larger company that specialises in celebrity guest bookings, publicity photography, and event promotion.[15]\nAlamuddin has three siblings: one sister and two half-brothers,[15] from her father's first marriage.[16]\nAlamuddin attended Dr Challoner's High School, a girls' grammar school located in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire. She then studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she received an Exhibition[17] and the Shrigley Award.[18] In 2000, Clooney graduated with a BA degree in Jurisprudence (Oxford's equivalent to the LLB).[19]\nThe following year, in 2001, she entered New York University School of Law to study for the LLM degree. She received the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law.[20][21] For one semester while at NYU, she worked in the office of Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[22]\nClooney is qualified to practice as a lawyer in the United States and the United Kingdom. She was admitted to the bar in New York in 2002, and in England and Wales in 2010. She has also practised at international courts in The Hague including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.[20]\nAlamuddin worked at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York City, for three years as part of the Criminal Defense and Investigations Group, where her clients included Enron and Arthur Andersen.[18][20]\nIn 2004, she completed a judicial clerkship at the International Court of Justice. She clerked under Judge Vladlen S. Vereshchetin from Russia, Judge Nabil Elaraby from Egypt,[23][24] and ad hoc Judge Sir Franklin Berman from the United Kingdom.\nShe was subsequently based in The Hague working in the Office of the Prosecutor at the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon and at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.[25]\nAlamuddin returned to Britain in 2010,[26] where she became a barrister in London (Bar of England &amp; Wales, Inner Temple) at Doughty Street Chambers.[18] In 2013 Clooney was appointed to a number of United Nations commissions, including as adviser to Special Envoy Kofi Annan on Syria and as Counsel to the 2013 Drone Inquiry by UN human rights rapporteur Ben Emmerson QC into the use of drones in counter-terrorism operations.[21][27]\nAlamuddin had been involved in high-profile cases representing the state of Cambodia, the former Libyan intelligence chief Abdallah Al Senussi, Yulia Tymoshenko[28] and Julian Assange, and was an adviser to the King of Bahrain in connection with the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry headed by Professor M. Cherif Bassiouni.[20]\nFor the spring 2015 and 2016 academic semesters, Clooney was a visiting faculty member and a senior fellow with Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute.[29][30] She was a co-professor with Sarah H. Cleveland in Cleveland's course on human rights and taught a class on human rights litigation to students in the school's Human Rights Clinic.[31][32]\nFor the spring 2018 semester, Clooney taught at Columbia Law School, again as a co-professor with Sarah H. Cleveland on a core class on human rights.[33]\nClooney has also lectured students on international criminal law at the Law School of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, The New School in New York City, The Hague Academy of International Law, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.[20]\nAs of 2011[update], Alamuddin was assisting the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the arbitration between Merck Sharp and Dohme and the Republic of Ecuador.[34]\nStarting in 2014, Clooney represented Canadian Al Jazeera English journalist Mohamed Fahmy who, along with other journalists, was being held in Egypt.[35][36][37][38] He was eventually sentenced to three years in prison and lost a retrial in August 2015 before finally being pardoned by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.[39][40]\nIn August 2014, Clooney declined a UN commission to look into possible violations of the rules of war in Gaza during the Gaza war of 2014.[41]\nIn October 2014, Clooney was hired in an attempt to repatriate the ancient Greek sculptures the Elgin Marbles.[42][43] In May 2015, Greece decided to stop legal proceedings to recover the sculptures and dismissed her as their brief.[44]\nIn January 2015, Clooney began work on the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[45] She is representing Armenia on behalf of Doughty Street Chambers along with Geoffrey Robertson QC.[46] She said Turkey's stance was hypocritical \"because of its disgraceful record on freedom of expression\", including prosecutions of Turkish-Armenians who campaigned for the 1915 massacres to be called a genocide.[45] She is representing Armenia in the case against Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek,[47][48] whose 2007 conviction for genocide denial and racial discrimination was overturned in Perin\u00e7ek v. Switzerland (2013).[45] A \"minor internet frenzy\" resulted from her bon mot prior to the 28 January 2015 hearing. In response to a journalist pestering her over what designer gown she would be wearing in court, she replied \"Ede &amp; Ravenscroft\"\u00a0\u2013  the tailors who make her court robes.[49][50]\nOn 8 March 2015, Clooney filed a case against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines before the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, a body under the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, for the continued detention of former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.[51] Arroyo was a sitting Pampanga congresswoman at the time. On 2 October, The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention later released its opinion that the detention of former President Arroyo \"violates international law\" and is \"arbitrary on a number of grounds\".[52]\nOn 7 April 2015, it was announced that Clooney would be part of the legal team defending Mohamed Nasheed, former President of the Maldives, in his ongoing arbitrary detention.[53] Nasheed was sentenced to 13 years in jail in March 2015 following what was characterized as a politically motivated trial.[54] Amnesty International described his sentencing as a \"travesty of justice\".[55][56] Prior to visiting the Maldives, the local co-counsel working on the case was stabbed in the head, an indication of the danger and instability in the country.[57] In January 2016, Clooney gave a series of interviews about the UN-condemned trial and imprisonment of Nasheed and put forth efforts to support imposing sanctions on the Maldives.[58][59] According to The Economist, she has \"helped strengthen the backing of Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, for the cause of Maldivian democracy.\"[60]\nIn June 2015, Clooney began work on the recently re-opened Hooded Men case[61] brought by the Irish government against the British government in the European Court of Human Rights.[62][63] Clooney worked with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Charles Flanagan[citation needed] on the case, which concerned policies used by UK Prime Minister Edward Heath (1970\u20131974) in Operation Demetrius that included the illegal interrogation methods known as five techniques.[64] In September 2018, the court rejected the final appeal in the case.[65]\nClooney is part of the legal team representing Louis Olivier Bancoult and Chagos islanders on their claim[66] that they had been forced off their island, Diego Garcia, in 1971 by the UK government to make way for a U.S. military base.[67]\nIn 2016, it was announced that Clooney would represent Azerbaijani journalist Khadija Ismayilova at the European Court of Human Rights. Ismayilova's investigative work had resulted in her imprisonment.[68] Following the trial, Ismayilova was released from prison and had her sentence reduced to a suspended three-and-a-half-year term.[69]\nIn September 2016, Clooney spoke\u00a0\u2013  for the first time at the United Nations\u00a0\u2013  before the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to discuss the decision she made in June 2016[70] to represent Nadia Murad as a client in legal action against ISIL commanders.[71][72][73] Clooney characterised the genocide, rape, and trafficking as a \"bureaucracy of evil on an industrial scale\" by ISIL, describing a slave market existing both online, on Facebook and in the Middle East that is still active today.[74]\nClooney, along with Ara Darzi, was involved in securing the release of two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, from Myanmar on 7 May 2019.[75]\nOn 25 February 2014, the UK Attorney General's Office appointed Clooney for the period 2014 to 2019 to the C Panel of the Public International Law Panel of Counsel.[76][77]\nIn May 2014, Clooney was a signatory of UNICEF UK and Jemima Khan's open letter that called for \"action from UK Government to protect women and children\".[78]\nOn 2 January 2015, it was reported by The Guardian that before Clooney was involved as Rapporteur in the case against Mohamed Fahmy, she had written a report in February 2014 for the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) that was critical of Egypt's judiciary process. Clooney and others were warned that there was a strong possibility they would be arrested if they entered Egypt, as a result of the criticism.[79][80]\nIn April 2019, Clooney became a special envoy at the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, advising the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt on global media freedom.[7][81] In her role as media freedom special envoy, Clooney will chair a panel of international lawyers to 'develop and promote legal mechanisms to prevent and reverse media abuses'.[82]\nClooney studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she received an Exhibition[17] and the Shrigley Award.[18] Clooney received the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law from NYU School of Law.[20][21]\nClooney was chosen as Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2015.[83] At the 2014 British Fashion Awards, Clooney was shortlisted for Best British Style alongside David Beckham, Kate Moss, Keira Knightley and Emma Watson.[84]\nClooney is the president of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which she co-founded with her husband George Clooney in late 2016 to advance justice in courtrooms, communities, and classrooms around the world.\nClooney partnered with the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative in beginning the Amal Clooney Scholarship, which was created to send one female student from Lebanon to the United World College Dilijan each year, to enroll in a two-year International Baccalaureate (IB) programme.[85]\nClooney and her husband sponsor a Yazidi student, Hazim Avdal, who Clooney met via her work with Nadia Murad as Avdal worked at Yazda. He is attending the University of Chicago.[86]\nIn 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the Clooneys pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives and said they would be in attendance.[87]\nClooney is fluent in English, French, and Arabic.[88][89]\nShe became engaged to actor George Clooney on 28 April 2014.[90] They had first met through a mutual friend in July 2013.[91]\nOn 7 August 2014, the couple obtained marriage licences in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London.[92]\nThey married on 27 September 2014 in Venice's city hall (at Ca' Farsetti),[93][94][95] following a high-profile wedding ceremony two days earlier, also[96] in Venice.[97][98][99] They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, former mayor of Rome.[99][100] The wedding was widely reported in the media.[101] In October 2014, it was announced that the Clooneys had bought the Mill House on an island in the River Thames at Sonning Eye in England[102] at a cost of around \u00a310 million.[103]\nIn February 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show The Talk that Clooney was pregnant.[104] Friend Matt Damon confirmed the pregnancy to Entertainment Tonight.[105] In June 2017, she gave birth to fraternal twins.[106]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nBrett Michael Kavanaugh (/\u02c8k\u00e6v\u0259n\u0254\u02d0/; born February 12, 1965) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed Anthony Kennedy and took the oath of office on October 6, 2018. He previously served as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and as a staff lawyer for various offices of the federal government.[2] Kavanaugh graduated from Yale University, where he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. After graduating from Yale Law School, he began his career as a law clerk and then a postgraduate fellow working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with various investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including the drafting of the Starr Report recommending Clinton's impeachment. After the 2000 U.S. presidential election, in which he worked for the George W. Bush campaign in the Florida recount, he joined the administration as White House Staff Secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Kavanaugh was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by President Bush in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious; they stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. He was ultimately confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006 after a series of negotiations between Democratic and Republican U.S. Senators.[4][5][2] An evaluation of Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions in four separate public policy areas was performed by two law professors for the Washington Post. It found he had the most conservative overall voting record on the D.C. Court between 2003 and 2018.[6] President Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. When Kavanaugh's name was on the short list of Supreme Court nominees and before his nomination, Palo Alto University Professor of Psychology Christine Blasey Ford contacted a Washington Post tip line with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s while the two were in high school.[7][8][9] Two other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.[10][11] Kavanaugh denied all three accusations. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over Ford's allegations, after which it voted to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote. After delaying the vote for an additional FBI investigation, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh's nomination by a vote of 50\u201348 on October 6, 2018.[12][13] Kavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[1] the son of Martha Gamble (n\u00e9e Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[14][15] He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States in the late 19th century from Roscommon, Ireland,[16][17] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[16] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[18] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She later earned a law degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[19][20] Kavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys college prep school, where he was two years ahead of future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.[21][22] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[23] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland State Senator Richard Madaleno.[24][25][26][27] After graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[28] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[29][30] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[31] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[31] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the Yale Daily News,[31] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[32][33] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts cum laude in history.[31] In October 2018, it was reported that Kavanaugh and Chris Dudley were in a bar fight in September 1985 after Kavanaugh threw ice[34][35][36][37] at a man who looked like Ali Campbell of UB40.[38][39] Kavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the Yale Law Journal and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41] Kavanaugh first worked as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[40] During Kavanaugh's clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] After clerking for Kozinski, Kavanaugh next interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court, but was not offered a clerkship.[40] In 1992,[42] Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr.[43] Also in 1992, he worked as a summer associate for Munger, Tolles & Olson.[44] He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993\u20131994,[42] working alongside fellow high school alumnus Neil Gorsuch and with future-Judge Gary Feinerman.[21] After his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In an op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for investing federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48] After working in private practice in 1997\u20131998, he rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In Swidler & Berlin v. United States (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the court to disregard attorney-client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6\u20133.[51] Kavanaugh was a principal author of the Starr Report to Congress, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton\u2013Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of the President's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail which the authors described as \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56] In December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, Kavanaugh was hired as an associate by the White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House Staff Secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president. From 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis. In 1999, Kavanaugh rejoined the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis as a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was pro bono counsel of record for relatives of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate Gonzalez to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the boy's return to his home.[60] While Kavanaugh was at Kirkland & Ellis, he authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in 2000, in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in Good News Club v. Milford Central School, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61] Kavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half of the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64] President George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][non-primary source needed] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh as \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but, after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[67] The Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10\u20138 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[68] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57\u201336.[69][70] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[71] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[72] In July 2007, Senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[73][74] The issue re-emerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[75] When Kavanaugh has written an opinion and the case has been considered by the Supreme Court, that court has adopted his position thirteen times while reversing his position only once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][76] He has been regarded as a feeder judge.[77] In the October 2017 Garza v. Hargan decision, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided-panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before travelling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously.\"[78][79] Days later, the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[79][80] In his dissent, Kavanaugh criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[81] The girl then obtained an abortion.[79] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the en banc D.C. Circuit's judgment was vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot.[82] Thus it does not serve as precedent. In November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[83][84] In his dissent concerning jurisdiction, he compared the individual mandate to a tax.[85] After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.[86][87] In May 2015, Kavanaugh dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of the Priests for Life v. HHS ruling in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In Zubik v. Burwell (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90] In August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the President.[91][92] In Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5\u20134.[93] In 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB Director removable by the President of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7\u20133, over the dissent of Kavanaugh.[98][99] In 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of mandamus requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum the orca.[102][103] After Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6\u20132 in EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P. (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and a fractured Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency (2014).[106][107] After Judge Kavanaugh dissented from a per curiam decision allowing the agency to disregard cost\u2013benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in Michigan v. EPA (2015).[108][109] In Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing in his dissent that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] Kavanaugh dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[76][112][113] Kavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and could forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] Those judgments were both summarily affirmed on direct appeal by the Supreme Court.[116] In 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the en banc D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC (2016), Kavanaugh dissented when the en banc circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule\".[43][119][120] In November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The circuit's judgment was then affirmed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Jones (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the en banc circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] In District of Columbia v. Wesby (2018), the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment.[125] In Klayman v. Obama (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an en banc rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata.[126][127] In his concurrence, Kavanaugh wrote that the metadata collection was not a search, and, even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128] In April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advanced notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In Kiyemba v. Obama (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the en banc D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135] In August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the en banc circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the en banc circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the en banc circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes under the law of war.[139][140] In Meshal v. Higgenbotham (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142] In October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008).[143][144] Twenty-five of Kavanaugh's forty-eight law clerks have been women, and thirteen have been people of color.[145] A number have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law Professor Amy Chua), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff).[146][147] On September 20, 2018, The Guardian reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Jed Rubenfeld stated that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\", although the source stated, Rubenfeld did not say what that look was.[148] Chua was reported by unnamed sources as having stated that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in their job interview with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, stating, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[148] Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[149] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction, with Professor Chua already returning to regular teaching in 2019.[150] On July 2, 2018, Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a potential replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy.[151] On July 9, Trump nominated Kavanaugh for a seat on the Supreme Court.[152][153] In his first public speech after the nomination, Kavanaugh said, \"No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.\"[154] A statistical analysis by The Washington Post estimated that Kavanaugh was more conservative than Neil Gorsuch and less conservative than Samuel Alito.[155] Jonathan Turley of George Washington University has stated that among the judges considered by Trump, \"Kavanaugh has the most robust view of presidential powers and immunities\".[156] Brian Bennett writing for Time magazine cites Kavanaugh's 2009 Minnesota Law Review article as defending the privilege of the President to immunity from prosecution during tenure in office.[156] In a 2017 speech at the American Enterprise Institute about former Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, he praised his opinions in Roe v. Wade and Furman v. Georgia, where Rehnquist dissented in rulings that overturned the ban against abortion and the statutes which supported the death penalty.[157][158] An evaluation of Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions was performed by two law professors for the Washington Post, They rated his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Court in three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[6] During his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had repeatedly described the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history as being the cases Brown v. Board of Education, Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown Steel, and United States v. Nixon, with Brown being the single greatest.[159] According to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas is the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. According to this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation would mean the composition of the court would shift to the right.[160] Had Merrick Garland been confirmed, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Justice Kennedy retired. However, since Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[161] The Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were at the onset delayed with objections from the Democratic members, concerning the absence of records during the nominee's time in the George W. Bush administration, prior to his service as a federal circuit court judge. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received at the 11th hour, the night before the first day of hearings.[162] Repeated statements from the Republicans included the assertion that the volume of documents available on this nominee equaled that of the previous five nominees for the court; the Democrats responded with their repeated contention that only 15% of demanded documents about the nominee had been obtained. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled to be out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Judge Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question and answer periods to begin the following day.[163] During the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve President Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of pre-existing healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, the precedent of Roe v. Wade, or the President's power to issue a self-pardon. The nominee was given the opportunity and expounded at length upon various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the President's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the prior session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections from Democrats.[164] The Committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails of Kavanaugh that related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing direct questions to opine on matters that he characterized as hypothetical.[165] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to The Intercept, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from the judge, Kavanaugh instead replied: \"I do not remember\".[166] Some time during his testimony, Kavanaugh stated that the 2017 exposure of his mentor, judge Alex Kozinski, as an alleged prolific sexual harasser, was a surprising \"gut punch\".The Guardian reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judiciary system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[167] The Committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [Roe v. Wade] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\"[168] Kavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since the time of the statement.[169] Sen. Susan Collins, a key but undeclared vote in the confirmation, indicated the statement did not contradict Kavanaugh's personal assurance to her that Roe is settled law.[170] Kavanaugh noted that Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, Casey is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[171] On September 27, the Committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused him.[172] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[173] Her questioning of Kavanaugh was cut short by Grassley, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[174][175] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh themselves.[176] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and Judge, both \u201cvisibly drunk\u201d, had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \u201cbelieved he was going to rape me\u201d and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[177][178][179] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack has denied that such an event took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[180] In response to his testimony, more than 2400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[181] At the conclusion of the hearing the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[182] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on the vote in the full Senate being delayed for a week to allow investigation of the current claims by the FBI. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[183] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within one week.[184] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where Senators were permitted one at a time to review the report in secrecy. Majority Leader McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[185] Democrats criticized the FBI investigation as incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[186][187] According to The Washington Post, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[188] Eighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh in regard to his conduct during his U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice John Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate the complaints. In December 2018, the judicial panel dismissed all 83 ethics complaints, concluding that while the complaints \"are serious,\" there is no existing authority that allows lower court judges to investigate or discipline Supreme Court justices.[189] On October 5, the Senate voted 51\u201349 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[190] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[191][192] On October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with a 50\u201348 vote.[193] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at the wedding of his daughter that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition, so that their two votes would be canceled out and the balance of the vote would be retained \u2013 a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[194] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to approve the nomination, and all Democrats voted in opposition, except Joe Manchin who voted to approve the nomination.[195] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. In terms of actual votes, the only Supreme Court confirmation vote that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by the margin of a single vote, 24-23; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[196][197][198] However, in percentage terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews'. Matthews was supported by 51.06% of the senators voting, but Kavanaugh only got 51.02% of the vote.[199] Kavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th Justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[200] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by retired Associate Justice Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[201][202][203] Upon joining the court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[204][205] Kavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court Justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for Stokeling v. United States and United States v. Stitt.[206] Kavanaugh is assigned to the Seventh Circuit (which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin).[207] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions).[208] Kavanaugh authored his first opinion on January 8, 2019, in the case of Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc., in which a unanimous Court reversed the appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[209] On February 27, Justice Kavanaugh joined Chief Justice Roberts and the court's liberal justices in Garza v. Idaho, a Sixth Amendment case in which the court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice of ineffective counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[210] In December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Chief Justice Roberts and the court's four more liberal justices to decline hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[211] In February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues to vote to reject a request for a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[212] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[213] CNBC reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[214] Also in February, Justice Kavanaugh was a part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, Kavanaugh was a part of the majority in a 5\u20134 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay the execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.[215] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's four liberal justices in a 6\u20133 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[216][217] In early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a The Washington Post tipline and her congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-California) with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was in high school.[8][218] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) to inform her of her sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh,[219] requesting that her accusation be kept confidential.[220] Following a September 12 report in The Intercept,[8][218][221] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein stated that the woman and Kavanaugh were both in high school when the woman accused Kavanaugh of trying to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[222][223] On the same day, Feinstein stated that she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[224][225] On September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[226][227] She stated that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[228] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[229] and believed he was going to rape her.[230] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[226][231] Kavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[225][224] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.[232][233] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before the scheduled testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[234] The Washington Post reported that it had reviewed a portion of the therapist's notes from a 2012 couples therapy session involving Ford and her husband that relate to the alleged event and its psychological effects upon her. In 2012, Ford and her husband were going through a major renovation of their home in which she insisted on having a second front door and which her husband could not understand.[235][236] The therapist's notes, parts of which were released on September 16, 2018, state that Ford was assaulted by four students \"from an elitist boys' school\" (Ford stated the therapist was in error and there were only two boys in the room with her[237]), who eventually became \"highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington,\" and do not name Kavanaugh. Ford's husband recalled that in the couples therapy session, while talking about the attack, she \"used Kavanaugh's last name\". Notes from another session a year later show that Ford had previously described a \"rape attempt\" while in her \"late teens.\" In her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said she could not remember whether she gave the therapist's notes to The Washington Post or merely summarized them for the reporter.[238] Ford also took a polygraph test that was paid for by her attorneys and administered by a former FBI agent.[239] The test concluded she was being truthful when she said that a statement that summarized her accusations was accurate.[229][240] On September 14 , The Senate Judiciary Committee released a letter that was signed by 65 women. The women stated that they had known Kavanaugh \"for more than 35 years\" and asserted that during the time they had known him, Kavanaugh had \"behaved honorably and treated women with respect\".[241] Twenty-four women\u2014who attended the Holton-Arms School with Ford\u2014sent a letter to Congress expressing support for her.[242] Over 1,000 alumnae of Holton-Arms School signed a letter stating that Ford's accusation was \"all too consistent with stories we heard and lived\" while attending the school;[243] some of the alumnae delivered the letter personally to Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, who is herself an alumna of the school.[244] On September 24, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to provide testimony about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 24.[245] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the Committee whether she intended to testify. Grassley added that Ford was welcome to appear before the Committee either privately or publicly.[246] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the Committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[247] A bipartisan panel from the Judiciary Committee and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[248] On September 17, President Trump commented for the first time on the initial sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh is one of the finest people that I've ever known. He's an outstanding intellect, an outstanding judge, respected by everybody. Never had even a little blemish on his record. The FBI has, I think, gone through a process six times with him over the years, where he went to higher and higher positions. He is somebody very special.\"[249] On September 20, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump again strongly endorsed Kavanaugh, stating, \"Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing or meeting.\" Trump also addressed the Democrats' demand for an FBI probe by asking why the FBI was not notified of the alleged attack 36 years ago.[250] Trump later responded on Twitter to Ford's claims, arguing that Ford would have informed law enforcement of the incident at the time if it had truly taken place. Trump wrote that Ford's statement was an \"assault\" made by \"radical left wing politicians\" intended to undermine his presidency.[251][252] Ford stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party nor sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[253] and Keyser told The Washington Post that she believed Ford's assertions.[254][255] On October 4, the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegations after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[256] Her attorneys tweeted that \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[188] Between September 10 and 16, 2018, Kavanaugh had the highest opposition (42%) of any of the eleven Supreme Court nominees Gallup has polled about since Robert Bork in 1987.[257][258] A YouGov/The Economist poll on September 23\u201325 found 55% of Republicans thought he should be confirmed even if the allegations of sexual assault were true, compared to 28% of the whole sample and 13% of Democrats.[259] Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of The New Yorker published a piece with an additional sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh on September 23, 2018. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983\u20131984 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[260] The New York Times interviewed several dozen of her classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[261] According to the New York Times, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[262] Michael Avenatti, the lawyer representing Stormy Daniels in her suit against Donald Trump, stated in a tweet on September 23, 2018 that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" regarding Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. Avenatti asserted that his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[263][264][265] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee, who declared in a sworn statement that she went to high school parties involving Kavanaugh and Judge and that it was common at such parties for boys to prey on girls, sometimes by spiking or drugging the drinks so that the girls could not resist.[266][267] Kavanaugh described her allegations as \"ridiculous\" and the allegation as a whole, made by Avenatti, a \"farce\".[11] The Wall Street Journal reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues, but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends have come forward publicly to support her claims.[268] Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley referred both Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that the two engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[269] Kavanaugh taught full-term courses on Separation of Powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. Kavanaugh has also been named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School since 2009.[270] Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, who was then the dean of Harvard Law School in 2008. According to The Boston Globe, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He would often dine in Cambridge with students and offer references and career advice.[271][272] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[273] Following allegations of sexual misconduct during his Supreme Court confirmation process, Harvard Law School graduates petitioned the university to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer. Shortly after, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[274] In the summer of 2019, Kavanaugh joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[275] In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the Minnesota Law Review in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[276] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis.[277] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly,\" that president may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and then criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[276] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[276] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[277] When reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[278] To remedy this, Kavanaugh encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\" such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[278] Kavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to President George W. Bush,[279] were married in 2004 and have two daughters. They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40] Kavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[280] His bibs represented nonqualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[281] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5\u00a0km to 10 miles.[282][283] Kavanaugh is a Catholic[279] and serves as a regular lector at his Washington, D.C., church, the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[279][284] At his May 2006 confirmation hearing to be circuit judge for The District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[285] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[286]",

He was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed Anthony Kennedy and took the oath of office on October 6, 2018. He previously served as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and as a staff lawyer for various offices of the federal government.[2]\nKavanaugh graduated from Yale University, where he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. After graduating from Yale Law School, he began his career as a law clerk and then a postgraduate fellow working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with various investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including the drafting of the Starr Report recommending Clinton's impeachment. After the 2000 U.S. presidential election, in which he worked for the George W. Bush campaign in the Florida recount, he joined the administration as White House Staff Secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Kavanaugh was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by President Bush in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious; they stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. He was ultimately confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006 after a series of negotiations between Democratic and Republican U.S. Senators.[4][5][2] An evaluation of Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions in four separate public policy areas was performed by two law professors for the Washington Post. It found he had the most conservative overall voting record on the D.C. Court between 2003 and 2018.[6]\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. When Kavanaugh's name was on the short list of Supreme Court nominees and before his nomination, Palo Alto University Professor of Psychology Christine Blasey Ford contacted a Washington Post tip line with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s while the two were in high school.[7][8][9] Two other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.[10][11] Kavanaugh denied all three accusations. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over Ford's allegations, after which it voted to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote. After delaying the vote for an additional FBI investigation, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh's nomination by a vote of 50\u201348 on October 6, 2018.[12][13]\nKavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[1] the son of Martha Gamble (n\u00e9e Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[14][15]  He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States in the late 19th century from Roscommon, Ireland,[16][17] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[16] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[18] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She later earned a law degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[19][20]\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys college prep school, where he was two years ahead of future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.[21][22] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[23] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland State Senator Richard Madaleno.[24][25][26][27]\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[28] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[29][30] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[31] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[31] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the Yale Daily News,[31] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[32][33] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts cum laude in history.[31] In October 2018, it was reported that Kavanaugh and Chris Dudley were in a bar fight in September 1985 after Kavanaugh threw ice[34][35][36][37] at a man who looked like Ali Campbell of UB40.[38][39]\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the Yale Law Journal and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\nKavanaugh first worked as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[40] During Kavanaugh's clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] After clerking for Kozinski, Kavanaugh next interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\nIn 1992,[42] Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr.[43] Also in 1992, he worked as a summer associate for Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson.[44] He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993\u20131994,[42] working alongside fellow high school alumnus Neil Gorsuch and with future-Judge Gary Feinerman.[21]\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he  reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In an op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for investing federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\nAfter working in private practice in 1997\u20131998, he rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the court to disregard attorney-client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6\u20133.[51]\nKavanaugh was a principal author of the Starr Report to Congress, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton\u2013Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of the President's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail which the authors described as \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56]\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, Kavanaugh was hired as an associate by the White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House Staff Secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was a partner at the law firm of Kirkland &amp; Ellis. In 1999, Kavanaugh rejoined the law firm of Kirkland &amp; Ellis as a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was pro bono counsel of record for relatives of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate Gonzalez to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the boy's return to his home.[60]\nWhile  Kavanaugh was at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, he authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in 2000, in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in Good News Club v. Milford Central School, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half of the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][non-primary source needed] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh as \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but, after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[67]\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10\u20138 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[68] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57\u201336.[69][70] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[71] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[72]\nIn July 2007, Senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[73][74] The issue re-emerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[75]\nWhen Kavanaugh has written an opinion and the case has been considered by the Supreme Court, that court has adopted his position thirteen times while reversing his position only once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][76] He has been regarded as a feeder judge.[77]\nIn the October 2017 Garza v. Hargan decision, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided-panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before travelling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously.\"[78][79] Days later, the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[79][80] In his dissent, Kavanaugh criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[81]  The girl then obtained an abortion.[79] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the en banc D.C. Circuit's judgment was vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot.[82] Thus it does not serve as precedent.\nIn November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[83][84] In his dissent concerning jurisdiction, he compared the individual mandate to a tax.[85] After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in Sissel v. United States Department of Health &amp; Human Services (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.[86][87] In May 2015, Kavanaugh dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of the Priests for Life v. HHS ruling in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In Zubik v. Burwell (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90]\nIn August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the President.[91][92] In Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5\u20134.[93]\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB Director removable by the President of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7\u20133, over the dissent of Kavanaugh.[98][99]\nIn 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of mandamus requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum the orca.[102][103]\nAfter Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6\u20132 in EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P. (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and a fractured Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency (2014).[106][107] After Judge Kavanaugh dissented from a per curiam decision allowing the agency to disregard cost\u2013benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5\u20134 in Michigan v. EPA (2015).[108][109]\nIn Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing in his dissent that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] Kavanaugh dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[76][112][113]\nKavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and could forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] Those judgments were both summarily affirmed on direct appeal by the Supreme Court.[116]\nIn 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the en banc D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC (2016), Kavanaugh dissented when the en banc circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule\".[43][119][120]\nIn November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The circuit's judgment was then affirmed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Jones (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the en banc circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] In District of Columbia v. Wesby (2018), the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment.[125]\nIn Klayman v. Obama (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an en banc rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata.[126][127] In his concurrence, Kavanaugh wrote that the metadata collection was not a search, and, even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128]\nIn April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advanced notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In Kiyemba v. Obama (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the en banc D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135]\nIn August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the en banc circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the en banc circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the en banc circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes under the law of war.[139][140]\nIn Meshal v. Higgenbotham (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142]\nIn October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008).[143][144]\nTwenty-five of Kavanaugh's forty-eight law clerks have been women, and thirteen have been people of color.[145] A number have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law Professor Amy Chua), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff).[146][147]\nOn September 20, 2018, The Guardian reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Jed Rubenfeld stated that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\", although the source stated, Rubenfeld did not say what that look was.[148] Chua was reported by unnamed sources as having stated that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in their job interview with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, stating, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[148]  Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[149] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction, with Professor Chua already returning to regular teaching in 2019.[150]\nOn July 2, 2018, Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a potential replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy.[151] On July 9, Trump nominated Kavanaugh for a seat on the Supreme Court.[152][153] In his first public speech after the nomination, Kavanaugh said, \"No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.\"[154]\nA statistical analysis by The Washington Post estimated that Kavanaugh was more conservative than Neil Gorsuch and less conservative than Samuel Alito.[155] Jonathan Turley of George Washington University has stated that among the judges considered by Trump, \"Kavanaugh has the most robust view of presidential powers and immunities\".[156] Brian Bennett writing for Time magazine cites Kavanaugh's 2009 Minnesota Law Review article as defending the privilege of the President to immunity from prosecution during tenure in office.[156] In a 2017 speech at the American Enterprise Institute about former Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, he praised his opinions in Roe v. Wade and Furman v. Georgia, where Rehnquist dissented in rulings that overturned the ban against abortion and the statutes which supported the death penalty.[157][158] An evaluation of Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions was performed by two law professors for the Washington Post, They rated his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Court in  three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[6]\nDuring his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had repeatedly described the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history as being the cases Brown v. Board of Education, Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown Steel, and United States v. Nixon, with Brown being the single greatest.[159]\nAccording to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas is the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. According to this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation would mean the composition of the court would shift to the right.[160] Had Merrick Garland been confirmed, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Justice Kennedy retired. However, since Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[161]\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were at the onset delayed with objections from the Democratic members, concerning the absence of records during the nominee's time in the George W. Bush administration, prior to his service as a federal circuit court judge. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received at the 11th hour, the night before the first day of hearings.[162] Repeated statements from the Republicans included the assertion that the volume of documents available on this nominee equaled that of the previous five nominees for the court; the Democrats responded with their repeated contention that only 15% of demanded documents about the nominee had been obtained. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled to be out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Judge Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question and answer periods to begin the following day.[163]\nDuring the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve President Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of pre-existing healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, the precedent of Roe v. Wade, or the President's power to issue a self-pardon. The nominee was given the opportunity and expounded at length upon various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the President's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the prior session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections from Democrats.[164]\nThe Committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails of Kavanaugh that related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing direct questions to opine on matters that he characterized as hypothetical.[165] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to The Intercept, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from the judge, Kavanaugh instead replied: \"I do not remember\".[166] Some time during his testimony, Kavanaugh stated that the 2017 exposure of his mentor, judge Alex Kozinski, as an alleged prolific sexual harasser, was a surprising \"gut punch\".The Guardian reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judiciary system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[167]\nThe Committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [Roe v. Wade] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\"[168]\nKavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since the time of the statement.[169] Sen. Susan Collins, a key but undeclared vote in the confirmation, indicated the statement did not contradict Kavanaugh's personal assurance to her that Roe is settled law.[170] Kavanaugh noted that Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, Casey is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[171]\nOn September 27, the Committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused him.[172] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[173] Her questioning of Kavanaugh was cut short by Grassley, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[174][175] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh themselves.[176] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and Judge, both \u201cvisibly drunk\u201d, had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \u201cbelieved he was going to rape me\u201d and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[177][178][179] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack has denied that such an event took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[180]  In response to his testimony, more than 2400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[181]\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[182] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on the vote in the full Senate being delayed for a week to allow investigation of the current claims by the FBI. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[183] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within one week.[184] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where Senators were permitted one at a time to review the report in secrecy. Majority Leader McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[185] Democrats criticized the FBI investigation as incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[186][187] According to The Washington Post, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[188]\nEighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh in regard to his conduct during his U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice John Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate the complaints. In December 2018, the judicial panel dismissed all 83 ethics complaints, concluding that while the complaints \"are serious,\" there is no existing authority that allows lower court judges to investigate or discipline Supreme Court justices.[189]\nOn October 5, the Senate voted 51\u201349 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[190] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[191][192]\nOn October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with a 50\u201348 vote.[193] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at the wedding of his daughter that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition, so that their two votes would be canceled out and the balance of the vote would be retained \u2013 a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[194] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to approve the nomination, and all Democrats voted in opposition, except Joe Manchin who voted to approve the nomination.[195] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. In terms of actual votes, the only Supreme Court confirmation vote that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by the margin of a single vote, 24-23; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[196][197][198] However, in percentage terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews'.  Matthews was supported by 51.06% of the senators voting, but Kavanaugh only got 51.02% of the vote.[199]\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th Justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[200] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by retired Associate Justice Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[201][202][203] Upon joining the court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[204][205]\nKavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court Justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for Stokeling v. United States and United States v. Stitt.[206]\nKavanaugh is assigned to the Seventh Circuit (which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin).[207] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions).[208]\nKavanaugh authored his first opinion on January 8, 2019, in the case of Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer &amp; White Sales, Inc., in which a unanimous Court reversed the appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[209]\nOn February 27, Justice Kavanaugh joined Chief Justice Roberts and the court's liberal justices in Garza v. Idaho, a Sixth Amendment case  in which the court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice of ineffective counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[210]\nIn December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Chief Justice Roberts and the court's four more liberal justices to decline hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[211]\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues to vote to reject a request for a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[212] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[213] CNBC reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[214]\nAlso in February, Justice Kavanaugh was a part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, Kavanaugh was a part of the majority in a 5\u20134 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay the execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.[215] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's four liberal justices in a 6\u20133 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[216][217]\nIn early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a The Washington Post tipline and her congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-California) with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was in high school.[8][218] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) to inform her of her sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh,[219] requesting that her accusation be kept confidential.[220] Following a September 12 report in The Intercept,[8][218][221] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein stated that the woman and Kavanaugh were both in high school when the woman accused Kavanaugh of trying to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[222][223] On the same day, Feinstein stated that she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[224][225]\nOn September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[226][227] She stated that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[228] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[229] and believed he was going to rape her.[230] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[226][231]\nKavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[225][224] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.[232][233] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before the scheduled testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[234]\nThe Washington Post reported that it had reviewed a portion of the therapist's notes from a 2012 couples therapy session involving Ford and her husband that relate to the alleged event and its psychological effects upon her. In 2012, Ford and her husband were going through a major renovation of their home in which she insisted on having a second front door and which her husband could not understand.[235][236] The therapist's notes, parts of which were released on September 16, 2018, state that Ford was assaulted by four students \"from an elitist boys' school\" (Ford stated the therapist was in error and there were only two boys in the room with her[237]), who eventually became \"highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington,\" and do not name Kavanaugh. Ford's husband recalled that in the couples therapy session, while talking about the attack, she \"used Kavanaugh's last name\". Notes from another session a year later show that Ford had previously described a \"rape attempt\" while in her \"late teens.\" In her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said she could not remember whether she gave the therapist's notes to The Washington Post or merely summarized them for the reporter.[238]\nFord also took a polygraph test that was paid for by her attorneys and administered by a former FBI agent.[239] The test concluded she was being truthful when she said that a statement that summarized her accusations was accurate.[229][240]\nOn September 14 , The Senate Judiciary Committee released a letter that was signed by 65 women. The women stated that they had known Kavanaugh \"for more than 35 years\" and asserted that during the time they had known him, Kavanaugh had \"behaved honorably and treated women with respect\".[241] Twenty-four women\u2014who attended the Holton-Arms School with Ford\u2014sent a letter to Congress expressing support for her.[242] Over 1,000 alumnae of Holton-Arms School signed a letter stating that Ford's accusation was \"all too consistent with stories we heard and lived\" while attending the school;[243] some of the alumnae delivered the letter personally to Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, who is herself an alumna of the school.[244]\nOn September 24, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to provide testimony about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 24.[245] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the Committee whether she intended to testify. Grassley added that Ford was welcome to appear before the Committee either privately or publicly.[246] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the Committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[247] A bipartisan panel from the Judiciary Committee and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[248]\nOn September 17, President Trump commented for the first time on the initial sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh is one of the finest people that I've ever known. He's an outstanding intellect, an outstanding judge, respected by everybody. Never had even a little blemish on his record. The FBI has, I think, gone through a process six times with him over the years, where he went to higher and higher positions. He is somebody very special.\"[249] On September 20, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump again strongly endorsed Kavanaugh, stating, \"Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing or meeting.\" Trump also addressed the Democrats' demand for an FBI probe by asking why the FBI was not notified of the alleged attack 36 years ago.[250] Trump later responded on Twitter to Ford's claims, arguing that Ford would have informed law enforcement of the incident at the time if it had truly taken place. Trump wrote that Ford's statement was an \"assault\" made by \"radical left wing politicians\" intended to undermine his presidency.[251][252]\nFord stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party nor sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[253] and Keyser told The Washington Post that she believed Ford's assertions.[254][255]\nOn October 4,  the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegations after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[256] Her attorneys tweeted that \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[188]\nBetween September 10 and 16, 2018, Kavanaugh had the highest opposition (42%) of any of the eleven Supreme Court nominees Gallup has polled about since Robert Bork in 1987.[257][258] A YouGov/The Economist poll on September 23\u201325 found 55% of Republicans thought he should be confirmed even if the allegations of sexual assault were true, compared to 28% of the whole sample and 13% of Democrats.[259]\nRonan Farrow and Jane Mayer of The New Yorker published a piece with an additional sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh on September 23, 2018. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983\u20131984 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[260] The New York Times interviewed several dozen of her classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[261] According to the New York Times, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[262]\nMichael Avenatti, the lawyer representing Stormy Daniels in her suit against Donald Trump, stated in a tweet on September 23, 2018 that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" regarding Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. Avenatti asserted that his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[263][264][265] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee, who declared in a sworn statement that she went to high school parties involving Kavanaugh and Judge and that it was common at such parties for boys to prey on girls, sometimes by spiking or drugging the drinks so that the girls could not resist.[266][267] Kavanaugh described her allegations as \"ridiculous\" and the allegation as a whole, made by Avenatti, a \"farce\".[11] The Wall Street Journal reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues, but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends have come forward publicly to support her claims.[268] Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley referred both Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that the two engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[269]\nKavanaugh taught full-term courses on Separation of Powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. Kavanaugh has also been named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School since 2009.[270] Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, who was then the dean of Harvard Law School in 2008. According to The Boston Globe, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He would often dine in Cambridge with students and offer references and career advice.[271][272] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[273] Following allegations of sexual misconduct during his Supreme Court confirmation process, Harvard Law School graduates petitioned the university to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer. Shortly after, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[274] In the summer of 2019, Kavanaugh joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[275]\nIn 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the Minnesota Law Review in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[276] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis.[277] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly,\" that president may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and then criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[276] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[276] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[277]\nWhen reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[278] To remedy this, Kavanaugh encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\" such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[278]\nKavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to President George W. Bush,[279] were married in 2004 and have two daughters. They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40]\nKavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[280] His bibs represented nonqualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[281] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5\u00a0km to 10 miles.[282][283]\nKavanaugh is a Catholic[279] and serves as a regular lector at his Washington, D.C., church, the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[279][284]\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to be circuit judge for The District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[285] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[286]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRafael Edward Cruz (/kru\u02d0z/; born December 22, 1970) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States Senator for Texas since 2013. He was the runner-up for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 election. Cruz holds degrees in public policy and law from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, respectively. From 1999 to 2003, he held various government positions, serving as Director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as an Associate Deputy Attorney General at the United States Department of Justice, and as a Domestic Policy Advisor to George W. Bush during Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Cruz served as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008, having been appointed by Texas Attorney General and later Governor Greg Abbott. He was the longest-serving solicitor general in Texas history and the first Hispanic American to serve in that capacity. From 2004 to 2009, Cruz was an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, where he taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation. In 2012, Cruz ran for and won the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. He is the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. Senator from Texas. In 2016, Cruz ran for President of the United States, winning Republican contests in 12 states before withdrawing from the race. He was reelected to the Senate in 2018, defeating Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke by a slim margin of 50.9% to 48.3% in the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history. Along with Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio, Cruz is one of three current U.S. Senators of Cuban descent. Cruz was born Rafael Edward Cruz on December 22, 1970,[1][2] at Foothills Medical Centre[3][4] in Calgary, Alberta, to Eleanor Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz.[5][6][7][8] Eleanor Wilson was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s.[9] Cruz's father was born and raised in Cuba. He left in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the U.S. after his four-year student visa expired.[10] He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973[3] and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005.[7][11][12] At the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling.[7][13][14][15][16] Cruz has said that he is the son of \"two mathematicians/computer programmers.\"[17] In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas.[18] Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston.[3] They divorced in 1997.[19] Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011.[19][20][21] Cruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas;[22] and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988.[11][23][24] During high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat.[16][25] Cruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in public policy[26] from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[1][27] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[28] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.[28] Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia.[29][30][31] Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[31] Cruz's senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison: \"If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state.[9][32] After graduating from Princeton, Cruz attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree.[1][33] While at Harvard Law, he was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review.[27] Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, Professor Alan Dershowitz said, \"Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant\".[34][35][36][37] At Harvard Law, Cruz was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics.[38] Cruz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Texas Review of Law and Politics.[39] Cruz served as a law clerk to J. Michael Luttig of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 1995[38][40] and to William Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, in 1996.[1] He was the first Hispanic to clerk for a Chief Justice of the United States.[41] After Cruz finished his clerkships, he took a position with Cooper, Carvin & Rosenthal, now known as Cooper & Kirk, PLLC, from 1997 to 1998.[42] At the firm, Cruz worked on matters relating to the National Rifle Association and helped prepare testimony for the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.[43] In 1998, Cruz was briefly one of the attorneys who represented Representative John Boehner during his litigation against Representative Jim McDermott over the alleged leak of an illegal recording of a phone conversation whose participants included Boehner.[44][45] Cruz joined the George W. Bush presidential campaign in 1999 as a domestic policy adviser, advising then-Governor Bush on a wide range of policy and legal matters, including civil justice, criminal justice, constitutional law, immigration, and government reform.[42] During the 2000 Florida presidential recounts, he assisted in assembling the Bush legal team, devising strategy, and drafting pleadings for filing with the Supreme Court of Florida and U.S. Supreme Court in the case Bush v. Gore.[38][46] Cruz recruited future Chief Justice John Roberts and noted attorney Mike Carvin to Bush's legal team.[43] After Bush took office, Cruz served as an Associate Deputy Attorney General in the U.S. Justice Department[1][46] and as the director of policy planning at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.[1][34][46] Appointed to the office of Solicitor General of Texas by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott,[40][47] Cruz served in that position from 2003 to 2008.[25][38] The office was established in 1999 to handle appeals involving the state, but Abbott hired Cruz with the idea that Cruz would take a \"leadership role in the United States in articulating a vision of strict constructionism\". As Solicitor General, Cruz argued before the Supreme Court of the United States nine times, winning five cases and losing four.[43] Cruz authored 70 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and presented 43 oral arguments.[34][40][48] His nine appearances before the Supreme Court are the most by any practicing lawyer in Texas or current member of Congress.[49] Cruz has said, \"We ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country. There was a degree of serendipity in that, but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights.\"[49] In 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office declined to defend Texas's sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning homosexual sex were unconstitutional.[50] In the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller, Cruz drafted the amicus brief signed by the attorneys general of 31 states arguing that the Washington, D.C. handgun ban should be struck down as infringing upon the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.[48][51] He also presented oral argument for the amici states in the companion case to Heller before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[48][52] In addition to his success in Heller, Cruz successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 5\u20134 in Van Orden v. Perry.[34][38][48] In 2004, Cruz was involved in the high-profile case surrounding a challenge to the constitutionality of public schools' requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words \"under God\", legally a part of the Pledge since 1954), Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow.[34][38] He wrote a brief on behalf of all 50 states that argued that the plaintiff, a non-custodial parent, did not have standing to file suit on his daughter's behalf.[53] The Supreme Court upheld the position of Cruz's brief.[54] Cruz served as lead counsel for the state and successfully defended the multiple litigation challenges to the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting plan in state and federal district courts and before the U.S. Supreme Court, which was decided 5\u20134 in his favor in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry.[38][55] In Medellin v. Texas, Cruz successfully defended Texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, all of whom were convicted of murder in the United States and on death row.[34][38][40][48] With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate.[43][56] They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case, which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the US had breached its obligations under the Convention.[57] Texas won the case in a 6\u20133 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them.[43][56] Michael Wayne Haley was arrested for stealing a calculator from Walmart in 1997.[58] Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying \"I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors.\"[59] The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process.[59] After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to \"time served\".[60] In 2008 American Lawyer magazine named Cruz one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America,[47][61] and The National Law Journal named him one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America.[62][63] In 2010 Texas Lawyer named him one of the 25 Greatest Texas Lawyers of the Past Quarter Century.[64][65] After leaving the Solicitor General position in 2008, Cruz worked in a private law firm in Houston, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, often representing corporate clients, until he was sworn in as U.S. senator from Texas in 2013.[9][38][66] At Morgan Lewis, he led the firm's U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice.[66] In 2010, he abandoned a bid for state attorney general when incumbent Attorney General Greg Abbott, who hired Cruz as Solicitor General, decided to run for reelection.[11] At Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz represented Pfizer in a lawsuit brought by a group of public hospitals and community health centers, who accused Pfizer of overcharging.[67] Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award.[68] Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award.[68] Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case.[69] Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired 30 days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won a second appeal using the same argument.[70] Cruz defended two record-setting $54-million personal injury awards in New Mexico at the appellate level, including one that had been thrown out by a lower court.[71] He represented a mentally disabled man who was allegedly raped by an employee of the facility where he lived, and the family of a 78-year-old resident of an Albuquerque nursing home who died of internal bleeding.[71][72] The settlements were sealed in both cases.[71][72] Cruz's victory in the Republican primary was described by the Washington Post as \"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\".[73] On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek reelection, Cruz announced his candidacy via a blogger conference call.[74] In the Republican senatorial primary, Cruz ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin[75] and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee;[76] Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState,[77] the FreedomWorks for America super PAC,[78] nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin,[79] Tea Party Express,[80] Young Conservatives of Texas,[81] and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint,[82] Mike Lee,[83] Rand Paul[84] and Pat Toomey.[85] He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul,[86] George P. Bush,[46] and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum.[87] Former Attorney General Edwin Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign.[46] Cruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination by a 14-point margin over Dewhurst, support for Dewhurst having plummeted while Cruz's vote total dramatically increased from the first round.[88] Cruz won despite being outspent by Dewhurst, who held a statewide elected office,[89] $19 million to $7 million.[89][90] In the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote.[91] According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney with the Hispanic vote in Texas.[92][93] After Time magazine reported that Cruz might have violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, he called his failure to disclose the connection an inadvertent omission.[94] In January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out nearly $1 million in low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report them on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law.[95] Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the FEC form.[96] There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong.[96] The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \"inadvertent\" and that he would file supplementary paperwork.[95] As of November 2018, Cruz has sponsored 105 bills of his own, including:[97] Cruz had a leading role in the October 2013 government shutdown.[98][99][100] Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech in an effort to hold up a federal budget bill and thereby defund the Affordable Care Act.[99][101][102] During the speech, Cruz quoted from the book \"Green Eggs and Ham\" by Dr. Seuss.[103] Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill.[100] In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the filibuster attempt because only 18 Republican Senators supported the filibuster.[100] To supporters, the move \"signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government\".[99] This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz \"2013 Person of the Year\" in an op-ed in The Hill, primarily for his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act.[104] Cruz was also named \"2013 Man of the Year\" by conservative publications TheBlaze,[105] FrontPage Magazine,[106] and The American Spectator,[107] \"2013 Conservative of the Year\" by Townhall.com,[108] and \"2013 Statesman of the Year\" by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.[109][110] He was a finalist for Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" in 2013.[111] To critics, including some Republican colleagues[100] such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.[99] Cruz has consistently denied any involvement in the 2013 government shutdown, even though he cast several votes to prolong it and was blamed by many within his own party for prompting it.[112][113] On April 1, 2014, Cruz introduced S. 2195, a bill that would allow the President of the United States to deny visas to any ambassador to the United Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.[114] The bill was written in response to Iran's choice of Hamid Aboutalebi as its ambassador.[115] Aboutalebi was involved in the Iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of American diplomats from the US embassy in Tehran were held captive in 1979.[115][116][117] Under the headline \"A bipartisan message to Iran\", Cruz thanked President Barack Obama for signing S. 2195 into law. The letter, published in the magazine Politico on April 18, 2014, starts with \"Thanks to President Obama for joining a unanimous Congress and signing S. 2195 into law\". Cruz also thanked senators from both political parties for \"swiftly passing this legislation and sending it to the White House\".[118][119][120] In his first two years in the Senate, Cruz attended 17 of 50 public Armed Services Committee hearings, 3 of 25 Commerce Committee hearings, 4 of the 12 Judiciary Committee hearings, and missed 21 of 135 roll call votes during the first three months of 2015.[121] In a November 2014 Senate speech, Cruz accused the president of being \"openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this Republic\".[122] In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient Roman senator Cicero against Catiline to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform.[122] Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in The Atlantic, said that Cruz's analogy was \"deeply disquieting\" because \"In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.\"[122] Cruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran \"will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism\".[123] In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of \"outrageous attacks\" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: \"We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.\"[123] Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz for his remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was \"way over the line\" and \"hurts the cause\".[124][125] After the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz expressed his view that the winner of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, rather than Obama, should appoint a new Justice.[126] In June 2016, Cruz blamed the Obama administration for the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator Omar Mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watchlist.[127] Following the terrorist attack on Nice, France, Cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the Obama administration having a \"willful blindness\" to radical Islamists.[128] With the passing of Fidel Castro in November, Cruz charged Obama with celebrating and lionizing Castro in public statements he made addressing the death.[129] On December 28, after Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the U.S.'s decision to allow a U.N. resolution to pass that condemned Israeli settlements \"on land meant to be part of a future Palestinian state\", Cruz denounced the speech as \"disgraceful\", and said that history would remember Obama and Kerry as \"relentless enemies of Israel\". Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a \"radical anti-Israel agenda\".[130] Cruz, who was one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics during the 2016 presidential campaign, became an important ally of President Trump's in the Senate.[131][132] In late January 2017, after Trump announced Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee, Cruz praised Gorsuch as \"brilliant and immensely talented\" in a written statement.[133] On February 23, while speaking at the 2017 CPAC, Cruz showed interest in Trump nominating young justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas.[134] On March 1, Cruz called Trump's joint address to Congress the previous day \"positive\" and \"unifying\".[135] Cruz said that during his visit to the Mar-a-Lago estate on March 18, he spoke with affiliates of Trump while negotiating the American Health Care Act.[136] On April 6, shortly after the Shayrat missile strike, Cruz released a statement displaying his interest in having Trump appeal to Congress to take \"military action in Syria\" to prevent Islamic terrorists from acquiring weapons stored in Syria.[137] In April 2018, in the blurb for Trump's entry on the Time 100 most influential people of 2017, Cruz wrote, \"President Trump is doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo.\"[138] Cruz's authorship of the blurb was criticized by Charles Pierce of Esquire,[139] Jay Willis of GQ,[140] and CNN's Chris Cillizza.[138] In January 2020, after Iran attacked two U.S. military bases in Iraq, Cruz made comments about the change in Iran policy under President Trump, saying that Obama's policy was appeasement and that the missiles used to attack the bases were bought with money the Obama administration had given Iran.[141] Cruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow Republican politicians, and his relationships with various Republican members of Congress have been strained.[142][143] In 2013, Cruz called Republicans he thought were insufficiently resistant to Obama's proposals a \"surrender caucus\".[142] He also called fellow Republicans out as \"squishes\" on gun-control issues during a Tea Party rally.[142] Cruz's role in the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of Republican colleagues.[143] Republican Senator John McCain was reported to have particularly disliked Cruz; in a Senate floor speech in 2013, McCain denounced Cruz's reference to Nazis when discussing the Affordable Care Act.[143] In March 2013, McCain also called Cruz and others \"wacko birds\" whose beliefs are not \"reflective of the views of the majority of Republicans\".[143] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, John Boehner described Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\",[144] while during an interview, Lindsey Graham said, \"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\"[145] In a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling \"a flat-out lie\" over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. \"What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie\", Cruz said.[146] Cruz's \"incendiary outburst\" was \"unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate\", according to Reuters.[146][147] In the same speech, Cruz assailed the \"Republican majority in both houses of Congresses\" for what Cruz called an insufficiently conservative record.[147] Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with McCain saying that the speech was \"outside the realm of Senate behavior\" and \"a very wrong thing to do\".[148] Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: \"I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie.\"[149] Cruz alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; McConnell denied there was any \"deal\", and that denial was what Cruz called a \"lie\". Hatch said McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.[150] Among Cruz's few close allies in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah.[151][152] Cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in June 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting \"the Washington cartel\".[153] When Boehner announced in September 2015 that he would step down and resign from the House, Cruz expressed his concern that before resigning Boehner might have \"cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure\".[154] The following month, the budget agreement passed in the House by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from Democrats and Boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through March 2017, and Cruz called the agreement \"complete and utter surrender\".[155] Cruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the \"nuclear option\", \"to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees\". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would \"ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks\".[156] Cruz ran for reelection to a second term in 2018.[157] The primary elections for both parties were held on March 6, 2018.[158] He easily won the Republican nomination with over 80% of the vote. He faced the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, in the general election.[159] The contest was unusually competitive for an election in Texas, with most polls showing Cruz only slightly ahead of O'Rourke. The race received significant media attention[160] and became the most expensive U.S. Senate election in history.[161] On November 6, 2018, Cruz defeated O'Rourke by a margin of 50.9% to 48.3%.[162] As early as 2013, Cruz was widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016.[163][164][165] On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC.[166] He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast.[167] In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote.[168] Cruz finished first in two presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference[169] and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention.[170] Cruz did speaking events in mid-2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, all early primary states, leading to speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a run for President in 2016.[171] Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin described Cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue.[43] On April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United.[172] The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates.[173] In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words \"growth and opportunity\" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician.[172] Cruz delivered one of many State of the Union responses in January 2015.[174] On March 23, 2015, Cruz announced his 2016 presidential candidacy for the GOP primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.[175] Also, at the same hour, he posted on his Twitter page: \"I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!\"[176] He was the first announced major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign.[177][178] During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.[179][180] HarperCollins published Cruz's book A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America on June 30, 2015.[181] The book reached the bestseller list of several organizations in its first week of release.[182][183] In the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cruz received over 7.8 million votes,[184][185] won 12 states, and earned 559 delegates.[186] He raised nearly $92 million, a record for a GOP primary candidate, much of it from small online donors. The Cruz campaign had more than 325,000 volunteers.[187] On February 1, 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses.[188] The Iowa win made him the first Hispanic to win either a presidential primary election or caucus.[188][189][190] Cruz received 28% of the vote.[190] On February 10, 2016, Cruz placed third in the New Hampshire primary, with about 12% of the vote.[191] On February 21, 2016, he placed third in the South Carolina Republican primary with about 22.3% of the vote.[192] On March 1, 2016, Super Tuesday primary day, Cruz won Texas by 17%, along with Alaska and Oklahoma, providing him with four state primary victories total.[193] In the Texas primary, Cruz received the most votes in all but six of the state's 254 counties.[194] On March 5, 2016, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins.[195][196][197] Cruz won his widest margin up to that point in Kansas, where he beat frontrunner Donald Trump by 25 points.[198] With his victories over Trump in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, Cruz established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination.[199][200] On March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote\u2014defeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory.[201] He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii.[201] On March 12, 2016, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote and 9 delegates, giving him his eighth statewide win.[202] On March 22, 2016, Cruz won the Utah Caucus with 69.2% of the vote, versus John Kasich with 16.8% and Donald Trump with 14%.[203] Because Cruz surpassed the 50% winner-take-all threshold, he won all 40 of Utah's delegates. This win was his ninth. On April 3, 2016, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates that was dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates.[204] On April 6, 2016, Cruz won the Wisconsin primary with 48.2% of the vote, with Trump receiving 35.1%. It was Cruz's tenth statewide win. Cruz won 36 of the possible 42 delegates available in Wisconsin. Trump received the other 6 delegates. On April 2 and 7\u20139, 2016, Cruz swept the Colorado congressional district and state conventions taking all 34 delegates.[205][206][207][208] This gave Cruz his eleventh state win. On April 16, 2016, Cruz won all 14 of Wyoming's at-large delegates in the state convention. This secured the majority of state delegates giving Cruz his twelfth state win.[209] On April 27, 2016, Cruz announced that, if he were selected as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate.[210] Shortly after losing overwhelmingly to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016, Cruz officially announced his decision to suspend his campaign.[211] Cruz has stated that when he was a child, his mother told him that she would have to make an affirmative act to claim Canadian citizenship for him, so his family assumed that he did not hold Canadian citizenship.[212] In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that Cruz had dual Canadian-American citizenship,[213][214] he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.[212][215] Several lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that Cruz is ineligible to become U.S. president have been filed.[216][217][218][219][220][221][222] No lawsuit or challenge has been successful, and in February 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, \"The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\"[223] Shortly after the campaign's end, Cruz indicated that he would be interested in restarting the bid if he were successful in the Nebraska primary,[224] which Trump instead won.[225] In the months following, several publications noted that Cruz still had not endorsed Trump,[226][227] Cruz explaining in June that he was \"watching and assessing\" to determine if he would support him in the forthcoming general election.[228] On July 7, after a meeting with Trump, Cruz confirmed that he would be speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[229] In his speech on July 20, the third day of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him. He instead told listeners to \"vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution\". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd.[230] The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\"[231][232] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.[233] On October 10, following the 2005 audio recording of Trump being released and several Republicans retracting their endorsements, Cruz reaffirmed his support, citing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as being \"manifestly unfit to be President\".[234] On November 15, Cruz met with President-elect Trump at the Trump Tower in New York City. It had been reported that Trump was considering Cruz for the position of U.S. Attorney General, but the position ultimately went to Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.[235] On November 28, in light of Trump showing a softer tone on his campaign promises, Cruz warned that justified backlash could ensue if he strayed from them.[236] Cruz has been backed by the billionaire Mercer family, including Robert and his daughter Rebekah.[237] Cruz is a critic of the rapprochement between Communist Cuba and the United States, saying on Fox News in December 2014 that the thaw in relations was a \"manifestation of the failures of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy\" that \"will be remembered as a tragic mistake\".[238] In July 2018, Cruz spoke at the Rally for Religious Freedom in Asia. Cruz said, \"'It is a pleasure to be here and stand in solidarity for the men and women across this globe who have been persecuted by communists... We must stand united, in shining light, in highlighting heroism, in highlighting courage, in speaking out for those like my family, like so many millions across the globe who've seen the jackboot of communism firsthand.'\"[239] Cruz has called for an end to \"overcriminalization, harsh mandatory minimum sentences, and the demise of jury trials\".[240] He supports the death penalty.[241] In his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz frequently mentioned his role as counsel for the State of Texas in Medell\u00edn v. Texas, a 2008 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that Texas has the legal right to ignore an order from the International Court of Justice directing the U.S. to review the convictions and sentences of dozens of Mexican nationals on death row.[242] Cruz has referred to Medell\u00edn as the most important case of his tenure as Texas solicitor general.[242] Cruz is a gun-rights supporter,[243] and opposes expanding gun control regulations.[244] In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt discussing the attack that killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Cruz said that \"the simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats\", and that the reason Democrats are soft on crime, is that convicted felons tend to vote Democratic.[245] In August 2015, in the wake of the ambush death of a Texas police officer who was gunned down while filling up at a gas station, Cruz said that police are \"feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down, as we see \u2013 whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response from senior officials, the President or the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That's wrong. It's fundamentally wrong. It's endangering all of our safety and security.\"[246] Cruz opposes the legalization of marijuana, but believes it should be decided at the state level.[247] Following the legalization of marijuana in Colorado he stated that, \"If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I personally don't agree with it, but that's their right.\"[248] Cruz has been described by the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies as a \"free trader\"[249] and as a \"free-trade advocate\" by The Wall Street Journal.[250] In 2013, Cruz proposed the abolition of the IRS and the implementation of a flat tax \"where the average American can fill out taxes on a postcard\".[251] Cruz is \"adamantly opposed to a higher minimum wage\".[252] Cruz wants to decrease the size of the government significantly. In addition to eliminating the IRS as described above, he has promised to eliminate four other cabinet-level agencies. Cruz proposes to eliminate the Department of Energy, the Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.[253] Cruz is a proponent of school choice[254] and opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative.[255] Cruz rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[256][257] He has said that \"the scientific evidence doesn't support global warming\".[258] He has also stated: \"They call anyone who questions the science who even points to the satellite data \u2013 they call you a, quote, 'denier'. Denier is not the language of science. Denier is the language of religion. It is heretic. You are a blasphemer. It's treated as a theology. But it's about power and money. At the end of the day, it's not complicated. This is liberal politicians who want government power.\"[258] In March 2015, he said that some people are \"global warming alarmists\" and, citing satellite temperature measurements, said that there had been no significant warming in 18 years.[257][258][259] Cruz voted against the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 that would have created the National Endowment for the Oceans and authorized more than $26 billion in projects to be built by the Army Corps of Engineers, at least $16 billion of which would have come from federal taxpayers.[260][261] Cruz voted against the bill because it neglected \"to reduce a substantial backlog of projects, to the detriment of projects with national implications, such as the Sabine\u2013Neches Waterway\".[262] Cruz stated that the Corps' responsibilities were expanded without providing adequate measures for state participation.[262] Proponents of the bill argued that it would provide steady funding to support research and restoration projects, funded primarily by dedicating 12.5% of revenues from offshore energy development, including oil, gas, and renewable energy, through offshore lease sales and production based royalty payments, distributed through a competitive grant program.[263] In 2017, Cruz was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[264] to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Cruz has received more than $2.5 million in campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.[265] Cruz has a lifetime score of 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters.[266] Cruz is a supporter of TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline,[267] and along with every other Republican senator was a cosponsor of legislation in support of the pipeline.[268] In a 2014 opinion editorial in USA Today, Cruz wrote that auditing the Federal Reserve System was a top Republican priority in 2015 and that he supported legislation that would allow the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, whose confirmation Cruz had tried to prevent, said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed any audit of the Federal Reserve and that \"For 50 years Congress has recognized that there should be an exception to GAO ability to audit the Fed to avoid any political interference in monetary policy.\"[269][270] In 2015, Cruz voted in favor of the USA Freedom Act, which reauthorized the USA Patriot Act but reformed some of its provisions.[271][272] Cruz has been an adamant opponent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the U.S. and other world powers, calling it \"catastrophic\" and \"disastrous\".[273][274] In 2013, Cruz stated that America had no \"dog in the fight\" during the Syrian Civil War and stated that America's armed forces should not serve as \"al-Qaeda's air force\".[275] In 2014, Cruz criticized the Obama administration: \"The president's foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS, indeed, was working to arm Syrian rebels that were fighting side by side with ISIS\", calling ISIS \"the face of evil\". In a statement opposing US intervention for regime change in Syria, Cruz said, \"If President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Sen. Rubio succeed in toppling [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, the result will be the radical Islamic terrorists will take over Syria, that Syria will be controlled by ISIS, and that is materially worse for U.S. national security interests.\"[276] In September 2016, Cruz backed the Obama administration's plan to sell more than $1.15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[277] In early January 2017, Cruz, along with Texas governor Greg Abbott and some others met with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen. Cruz criticized the People's Republic of China after it reportedly made a statement asking members of Congress not to meet with Tsai.[278][279][280] On January 5, 2017, Cruz voted in favor of a House resolution condemning UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[281] In June 2017, Cruz co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[282][283] In August 2018, Cruz and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China's Xinjiang region.[284] They wrote: \"The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in \"political reeducation\" centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.\"[285] On December 18, 2018, Cruz and Senator Tom Cotton put forth a resolution in the U.S. Senate urging the United States to affirm Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.[286] Cruz is a strong critic of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA or \"Obamacare\"). He has sponsored legislation that would repeal the health care reform law and its amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Cruz was part of the group of 13 Senators that drafted the Senate version of the AHCA behind closed doors.[287][288][289][290] In 2013, Cruz voted against the bill to provide a package of federal aid to the East Coast for recovery from Hurricane Sandy.[291] Cruz said that he did not vote for Sandy disaster relief because the bill was \"filled with unrelated pork\" and that \"two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy\". The Washington Post disputed this, writing \"The bill was largely aimed at dealing with Sandy, along with relatively minor items to address other or future disasters.\"[292] The New York Times wrote that \"Of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one \u2014 $195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services \u2014 were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required.\"[293] In 2015, in the wake of fatal flooding in Texas, Cruz supported federal aid funding; in 2017, he called for federal intervention as Hurricane Harvey approached the coast of Texas.[294] Cruz adopted a \"hard-line stance\" on immigration issues during the 2014 border crisis[295] and is an opponent of comprehensive immigration reform.[43][295] Cruz advocates for an increase from 65,000 to 325,000 annually in skilled foreign workers entering the United States using H-1B visas.[296] According to McClatchy, Cruz staked out \"hard-right immigration stances\" during his 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination for President.[297] Cruz opposes providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children (so-called DREAMers).[298] In February 2018, he was the sole Senator to oppose a Republican motion to begin debate on legislation intended to resolve the question of what to do with DREAMers.[299] Cruz has called for the repeal of the clause of the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the United States.[300] Cruz defended the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents.[301][302] Cruz blamed the migrant parents for crossing the US border to seek asylum and argued that the Obama administration had the same policy.[301][302] Cruz opposes net neutrality\u2014which prevents Internet service providers from deliberately blocking or slowing particular websites\u2014arguing that the Internet economy has flourished in the United States simply because it has remained largely free from government regulation.[303] Cruz has argued that net neutrality is the \"Obamacare for the internet\".[304][305] Cruz said that the Obama-era implementation of the principle of net neutrality had the \"end result\" of \"less broadband, less innovation, and less freedom for the American consumer\".[305] In December 2017, after the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality, Cruz mocked supporters of net neutrality as \"snowflakes\" who were misled by \"online propaganda\".[306] On abortion, Cruz is \"strongly pro-life\" and \"would allow the procedure only when a pregnancy endangers the mother's life\".[307][308] He is in favor of cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.[309] Cruz opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[310] He believes that marriage should be legally defined as only \"between one man and one woman\",[311] but believes that the legality of same-sex marriage should be left to each state to decide.[312] Cruz referred to the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide as \"among the darkest hours of our nation\" and accused the court of judicial activism.[313] Cruz married Heidi Nelson on May 27, 2001;[314] they have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine.[315] The couple met when Cruz was working on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Heidi took leave from her position as head of the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman, Sachs & Co. in 2016 to support Ted Cruz's run for the U.S. president.[316] She previously worked in the White House for Condoleezza Rice and in New York as an investment banker.[317] Cruz has joked, \"I'm Cuban, Irish, and Italian, and yet somehow I ended up Southern Baptist.\"[318] He loves to wear cowboy boots, but he refrained from doing so when arguing before the Rehnquist court.[319] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

He was the runner-up for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 election.\nCruz holds degrees in public policy and law from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, respectively. From 1999 to 2003, he held various government positions, serving as Director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as an Associate Deputy Attorney General at the United States Department of Justice, and as a Domestic Policy Advisor to George W. Bush during Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Cruz served as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008, having been appointed by Texas Attorney General and later Governor Greg Abbott. He was the longest-serving solicitor general in Texas history and the first Hispanic American to serve in that capacity. From 2004 to 2009, Cruz was an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, where he taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation.\nIn 2012, Cruz ran for and won the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. He is the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. Senator from Texas. In 2016, Cruz ran for President of the United States, winning Republican contests in 12 states before withdrawing from the race. He was reelected to the Senate in 2018, defeating Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke by a slim margin of 50.9% to 48.3% in the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history. Along with Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio, Cruz is one of three current U.S. Senators of Cuban descent.\nCruz was born Rafael Edward Cruz on December 22, 1970,[1][2] at Foothills Medical Centre[3][4] in Calgary, Alberta, to Eleanor Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz.[5][6][7][8] Eleanor Wilson was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s.[9]\nCruz's father was born and raised in Cuba. He left in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the U.S. after his four-year student visa expired.[10] He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973[3] and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005.[7][11][12]\nAt the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling.[7][13][14][15][16] Cruz has said that he is the son of \"two mathematicians/computer programmers.\"[17] In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas.[18] Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston.[3] They divorced in 1997.[19] Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011.[19][20][21]\nCruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas;[22] and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988.[11][23][24]\nDuring high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat.[16][25]\nCruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in public policy[26] from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[1][27] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[28] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.[28] Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia.[29][30][31] Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[31]\nCruz's senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison: \"If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state.[9][32]\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Cruz attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree.[1][33] While at Harvard Law, he was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review.[27] Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, Professor Alan Dershowitz said, \"Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant\".[34][35][36][37] At Harvard Law, Cruz was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics.[38]\nCruz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Texas Review of Law and Politics.[39]\nCruz served as a law clerk to J. Michael Luttig of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 1995[38][40] and to William Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, in 1996.[1] He was the first Hispanic to clerk for a Chief Justice of the United States.[41]\nAfter Cruz finished his clerkships, he took a position with Cooper, Carvin &amp; Rosenthal, now known as Cooper &amp; Kirk, PLLC, from 1997 to 1998.[42] At the firm, Cruz worked on matters relating to the National Rifle Association and helped prepare testimony for the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.[43] In 1998, Cruz was briefly one of the attorneys who represented Representative John Boehner during his litigation against Representative Jim McDermott over the alleged leak of an illegal recording of a phone conversation whose participants included Boehner.[44][45]\nCruz joined the George W. Bush presidential campaign in 1999 as a domestic policy adviser, advising then-Governor Bush on a wide range of policy and legal matters, including civil justice, criminal justice, constitutional law, immigration, and government reform.[42] During the 2000 Florida presidential recounts, he assisted in assembling the Bush legal team, devising strategy, and drafting pleadings for filing with the Supreme Court of Florida and U.S. Supreme Court in the case Bush v. Gore.[38][46] Cruz recruited future Chief Justice John Roberts and noted attorney Mike Carvin to Bush's legal team.[43]\nAfter Bush took office, Cruz served as an Associate Deputy Attorney General in the U.S. Justice Department[1][46] and as the director of policy planning at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.[1][34][46]\nAppointed to the office of Solicitor General of Texas by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott,[40][47] Cruz served in that position from 2003 to 2008.[25][38] The office was established in 1999 to handle appeals involving the state, but Abbott hired Cruz with the idea that Cruz would take a \"leadership role in the United States in articulating a vision of strict constructionism\". As Solicitor General, Cruz argued before the Supreme Court of the United States nine times, winning five cases and losing four.[43]\nCruz authored 70 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and presented 43 oral arguments.[34][40][48] His nine appearances before the Supreme Court are the most by any practicing lawyer in Texas or current member of Congress.[49] Cruz has said, \"We ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country. There was a degree of serendipity in that, but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights.\"[49]\nIn 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office declined to defend Texas's sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning homosexual sex were unconstitutional.[50]\nIn the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller, Cruz drafted the amicus brief signed by the attorneys general of 31 states arguing that the Washington, D.C. handgun ban should be struck down as infringing upon the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.[48][51] He also presented oral argument for the amici states in the companion case to Heller before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[48][52]\nIn addition to his success in Heller, Cruz successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 5\u20134 in Van Orden v. Perry.[34][38][48]\nIn 2004, Cruz was involved in the high-profile case surrounding a challenge to the constitutionality of public schools' requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words \"under God\", legally a part of the Pledge since 1954), Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow.[34][38] He wrote a brief on behalf of all 50 states that argued that the plaintiff, a non-custodial parent, did not have standing to file suit on his daughter's behalf.[53] The Supreme Court upheld the position of Cruz's brief.[54]\nCruz served as lead counsel for the state and successfully defended the multiple litigation challenges to the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting plan in state and federal district courts and before the U.S. Supreme Court, which was decided 5\u20134 in his favor in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry.[38][55]\nIn Medellin v. Texas, Cruz successfully defended Texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, all of whom were convicted of murder in the United States and on death row.[34][38][40][48] With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate.[43][56] They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case, which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the US had breached its obligations under the Convention.[57] Texas won the case in a 6\u20133 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them.[43][56]\nMichael Wayne Haley was arrested for stealing a calculator from Walmart in 1997.[58] Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying \"I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors.\"[59] The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process.[59] After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to \"time served\".[60]\nIn 2008 American Lawyer magazine named Cruz one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America,[47][61] and The National Law Journal named him one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America.[62][63] In 2010 Texas Lawyer named him one of the 25 Greatest Texas Lawyers of the Past Quarter Century.[64][65]\nAfter leaving the Solicitor General position in 2008, Cruz worked in a private law firm in Houston, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP, often representing corporate clients, until he was sworn in as U.S. senator from Texas in 2013.[9][38][66] At Morgan Lewis, he led the firm's U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice.[66] In 2010, he abandoned a bid for state attorney general when incumbent Attorney General Greg Abbott, who hired Cruz as Solicitor General, decided to run for reelection.[11]\nAt Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, Cruz represented Pfizer in a lawsuit brought by a group of public hospitals and community health centers, who accused Pfizer of overcharging.[67] Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award.[68] Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award.[68] Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case.[69] Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired 30 days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won a second appeal using the same argument.[70]\nCruz defended two record-setting $54-million personal injury awards in New Mexico at the appellate level, including one that had been thrown out by a lower court.[71] He represented a mentally disabled man who was allegedly raped by an employee of the facility where he lived, and the family of a 78-year-old resident of an Albuquerque nursing home who died of internal bleeding.[71][72] The settlements were sealed in both cases.[71][72]\nCruz's victory in the Republican primary was described by the Washington Post as \"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\".[73] On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek reelection, Cruz announced his candidacy via a blogger conference call.[74] In the Republican senatorial primary, Cruz ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin[75] and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee;[76] Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState,[77] the FreedomWorks for America super PAC,[78] nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin,[79] Tea Party Express,[80] Young Conservatives of Texas,[81] and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint,[82] Mike Lee,[83] Rand Paul[84] and Pat Toomey.[85] He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul,[86] George P. Bush,[46] and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum.[87] Former Attorney General Edwin Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign.[46]\nCruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination by a 14-point margin over Dewhurst, support for Dewhurst having plummeted while Cruz's vote total dramatically increased from the first round.[88] Cruz won despite being outspent by Dewhurst, who held a statewide elected office,[89] $19 million to $7 million.[89][90]\nIn the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote.[91] According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney with the Hispanic vote in Texas.[92][93]\nAfter Time magazine reported that Cruz might have violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, he called his failure to disclose the connection an inadvertent omission.[94]\nIn January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out nearly $1 million in low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report them on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law.[95] Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the FEC form.[96] There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong.[96] The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \"inadvertent\" and that he would file supplementary paperwork.[95]\nAs of November 2018, Cruz has sponsored 105 bills of his own, including:[97]\nCruz had a leading role in the October 2013 government shutdown.[98][99][100] Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech in an effort to hold up a federal budget bill and thereby defund the Affordable Care Act.[99][101][102] During the speech, Cruz quoted from the book \"Green Eggs and Ham\" by Dr. Seuss.[103] Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill.[100] In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the filibuster attempt because only 18 Republican Senators supported the filibuster.[100] To supporters, the move \"signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government\".[99] This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz \"2013 Person of the Year\" in an op-ed in The Hill, primarily for his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act.[104] Cruz was also named \"2013 Man of the Year\" by conservative publications TheBlaze,[105] FrontPage Magazine,[106] and The American Spectator,[107] \"2013 Conservative of the Year\" by Townhall.com,[108] and \"2013 Statesman of the Year\" by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.[109][110] He was a finalist for Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" in 2013.[111] To critics, including some Republican colleagues[100] such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.[99]\nCruz has consistently denied any involvement in the 2013 government shutdown, even though he cast several votes to prolong it and was blamed by many within his own party for prompting it.[112][113]\nOn April 1, 2014, Cruz introduced S. 2195, a bill that would allow the President of the United States to deny visas to any ambassador to the United Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.[114] The bill was written in response to Iran's choice of Hamid Aboutalebi as its ambassador.[115] Aboutalebi was involved in the Iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of American diplomats from the US embassy in Tehran were held captive in 1979.[115][116][117]\nUnder the headline \"A bipartisan message to Iran\", Cruz thanked President Barack Obama for signing S. 2195 into law. The letter, published in the magazine Politico on April 18, 2014, starts with \"Thanks to President Obama for joining a unanimous Congress and signing S. 2195 into law\". Cruz also thanked senators from both political parties for \"swiftly passing this legislation and sending it to the White House\".[118][119][120]\nIn his first two years in the Senate, Cruz attended 17 of 50 public Armed Services Committee hearings, 3 of 25 Commerce Committee hearings, 4 of the 12 Judiciary Committee hearings, and missed 21 of 135 roll call votes during the first three months of 2015.[121]\nIn a November 2014 Senate speech, Cruz accused the president of being \"openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this Republic\".[122] In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient Roman senator Cicero against Catiline to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform.[122] Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in The Atlantic, said that Cruz's analogy was \"deeply disquieting\" because \"In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.\"[122]\nCruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran \"will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism\".[123] In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of \"outrageous attacks\" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: \"We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.\"[123] Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz for his remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was \"way over the line\" and \"hurts the cause\".[124][125]\nAfter the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz expressed his view that the winner of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, rather than Obama, should appoint a new Justice.[126] In June 2016, Cruz blamed the Obama administration for the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator Omar Mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watchlist.[127] Following the terrorist attack on Nice, France, Cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the Obama administration having a \"willful blindness\" to radical Islamists.[128] With the passing of Fidel Castro in November, Cruz charged Obama with celebrating and lionizing Castro in public statements he made addressing the death.[129] On December 28, after Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the U.S.'s decision to allow a U.N. resolution to pass that condemned Israeli settlements \"on land meant to be part of a future Palestinian state\", Cruz denounced the speech as \"disgraceful\", and said that history would remember Obama and Kerry as \"relentless enemies of Israel\". Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a \"radical anti-Israel agenda\".[130]\nCruz, who was one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics during the 2016 presidential campaign, became an important ally of President Trump's in the Senate.[131][132]\nIn late January 2017, after Trump announced Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee, Cruz praised Gorsuch as \"brilliant and immensely talented\" in a written statement.[133] On February 23, while speaking at the 2017 CPAC, Cruz showed interest in Trump nominating young justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas.[134] On March 1, Cruz called Trump's joint address to Congress the previous day \"positive\" and \"unifying\".[135] Cruz said that during his visit to the Mar-a-Lago estate on March 18, he spoke with affiliates of Trump while negotiating the American Health Care Act.[136] On April 6, shortly after the Shayrat missile strike, Cruz released a statement displaying his interest in having Trump appeal to Congress to take \"military action in Syria\" to prevent Islamic terrorists from acquiring weapons stored in Syria.[137]\nIn April 2018, in the blurb for Trump's entry on the Time 100 most influential people of 2017, Cruz wrote, \"President Trump is doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo.\"[138] Cruz's authorship of the blurb was criticized by Charles Pierce of Esquire,[139] Jay Willis of GQ,[140] and CNN's Chris Cillizza.[138]\nIn January 2020, after Iran attacked two U.S. military bases in Iraq, Cruz made comments about the change in Iran policy under President Trump, saying that Obama's policy was appeasement and that the missiles used to attack the bases were bought with money the Obama administration had given Iran.[141]\nCruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow Republican politicians, and his relationships with various Republican members of Congress have been strained.[142][143] In 2013, Cruz called Republicans he thought were insufficiently resistant to Obama's proposals a \"surrender caucus\".[142] He also called fellow Republicans out as \"squishes\" on gun-control issues during a Tea Party rally.[142] Cruz's role in the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of Republican colleagues.[143] Republican Senator John McCain was reported to have particularly disliked Cruz; in a Senate floor speech in 2013, McCain denounced Cruz's reference to Nazis when discussing the Affordable Care Act.[143] In March 2013, McCain also called Cruz and others \"wacko birds\" whose beliefs are not \"reflective of the views of the majority of Republicans\".[143] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, John Boehner described Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\",[144] while during an interview, Lindsey Graham said, \"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\"[145]\nIn a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling \"a flat-out lie\" over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. \"What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie\", Cruz said.[146] Cruz's \"incendiary outburst\" was \"unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate\", according to Reuters.[146][147] In the same speech, Cruz assailed the \"Republican majority in both houses of Congresses\" for what Cruz called an insufficiently conservative record.[147] Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with McCain saying that the speech was \"outside the realm of Senate behavior\" and \"a very wrong thing to do\".[148] Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: \"I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie.\"[149] Cruz alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; McConnell denied there was any \"deal\", and that denial was what Cruz called a \"lie\". Hatch said McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.[150]\nAmong Cruz's few close allies in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah.[151][152] Cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in June 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting \"the Washington cartel\".[153]\nWhen Boehner announced in September 2015 that he would step down and resign from the House, Cruz expressed his concern that before resigning Boehner might have \"cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure\".[154] The following month, the budget agreement passed in the House by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from Democrats and Boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through March 2017, and Cruz called the agreement \"complete and utter surrender\".[155]\nCruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the \"nuclear option\", \"to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees\". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would \"ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks\".[156]\nCruz ran for reelection to a second term in 2018.[157] The primary elections for both parties were held on March 6, 2018.[158] He easily won the Republican nomination with over 80% of the vote. He faced the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, in the general election.[159] The contest was unusually competitive for an election in Texas, with most polls showing Cruz only slightly ahead of O'Rourke. The race received significant media attention[160] and became the most expensive U.S. Senate election in history.[161]\nOn November 6, 2018, Cruz defeated O'Rourke by a margin of 50.9% to 48.3%.[162]\nAs early as 2013, Cruz was widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016.[163][164][165] On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC.[166] He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast.[167] In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote.[168] Cruz finished first in two presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference[169] and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention.[170]\nCruz did speaking events in mid-2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, all early primary states, leading to speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a run for President in 2016.[171] Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin described Cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue.[43]\nOn April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United.[172] The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates.[173] In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words \"growth and opportunity\" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician.[172]\nCruz delivered one of many State of the Union responses in January 2015.[174]\nOn March 23, 2015, Cruz announced his 2016 presidential candidacy for the GOP primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.[175] Also, at the same hour, he posted on his Twitter page: \"I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!\"[176] He was the first announced major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign.[177][178] During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.[179][180]\nHarperCollins published Cruz's book A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America on June 30, 2015.[181] The book reached the bestseller list of several organizations in its first week of release.[182][183]\nIn the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cruz received over 7.8 million votes,[184][185] won 12 states, and earned 559 delegates.[186] He raised nearly $92 million, a record for a GOP primary candidate, much of it from small online donors. The Cruz campaign had more than 325,000 volunteers.[187]\nOn February 1, 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses.[188] The Iowa win made him the first Hispanic to win either a presidential primary election or caucus.[188][189][190] Cruz received 28% of the vote.[190] On February 10, 2016, Cruz placed third in the New Hampshire primary, with about 12% of the vote.[191] On February 21, 2016, he placed third in the South Carolina Republican primary with about 22.3% of the vote.[192]\nOn March 1, 2016, Super Tuesday primary day, Cruz won Texas by 17%, along with Alaska and Oklahoma, providing him with four state primary victories total.[193] In the Texas primary, Cruz received the most votes in all but six of the state's 254 counties.[194] On March 5, 2016, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins.[195][196][197]\nCruz won his widest margin up to that point in Kansas, where he beat frontrunner Donald Trump by 25 points.[198] With his victories over Trump in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, Cruz established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination.[199][200]\nOn March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote\u2014defeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory.[201] He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii.[201] On March 12, 2016, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote and 9 delegates, giving him his eighth statewide win.[202]\nOn March 22, 2016, Cruz won the Utah Caucus with 69.2% of the vote, versus John Kasich with 16.8% and Donald Trump with 14%.[203] Because Cruz surpassed the 50% winner-take-all threshold, he won all 40 of Utah's delegates. This win was his ninth. On April 3, 2016, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates that was dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates.[204]\nOn April 6, 2016, Cruz won the Wisconsin primary with 48.2% of the vote, with Trump receiving 35.1%. It was Cruz's tenth statewide win. Cruz won 36 of the possible 42 delegates available in Wisconsin. Trump received the other 6 delegates. On April 2 and 7\u20139, 2016, Cruz swept the Colorado congressional district and state conventions taking all 34 delegates.[205][206][207][208] This gave Cruz his eleventh state win. On April 16, 2016, Cruz won all 14 of Wyoming's at-large delegates in the state convention. This secured the majority of state delegates giving Cruz his twelfth state win.[209] On April 27, 2016, Cruz announced that, if he were selected as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate.[210] Shortly after losing overwhelmingly to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016, Cruz officially announced his decision to suspend his campaign.[211]\nCruz has stated that when he was a child, his mother told him that she would have to make an affirmative act to claim Canadian citizenship for him, so his family assumed that he did not hold Canadian citizenship.[212] In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that Cruz had dual Canadian-American citizenship,[213][214] he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.[212][215]\nSeveral lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that Cruz is ineligible to become U.S. president have been filed.[216][217][218][219][220][221][222] No lawsuit or challenge has been successful, and in February 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, \"The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\"[223]\nShortly after the campaign's end, Cruz indicated that he would be interested in restarting the bid if he were successful in the Nebraska primary,[224] which Trump instead won.[225]\nIn the months following, several publications noted that Cruz still had not endorsed Trump,[226][227] Cruz explaining in June that he was \"watching and assessing\" to determine if he would support him in the forthcoming general election.[228] On July 7, after a meeting with Trump, Cruz confirmed that he would be speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[229]\nIn his speech on July 20, the third day of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him. He instead told listeners to \"vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution\". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd.[230] The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\"[231][232] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.[233]\nOn October 10, following the 2005 audio recording of Trump being released and several Republicans retracting their endorsements, Cruz reaffirmed his support, citing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as being \"manifestly unfit to be President\".[234] On November 15, Cruz met with President-elect Trump at the Trump Tower in New York City. It had been reported that Trump was considering Cruz for the position of U.S. Attorney General, but the position ultimately went to Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.[235] On November 28, in light of Trump showing a softer tone on his campaign promises, Cruz warned that justified backlash could ensue if he strayed from them.[236]\nCruz has been backed by the billionaire Mercer family, including Robert and his daughter Rebekah.[237]\nCruz is a critic of the rapprochement between Communist Cuba and the United States, saying on Fox News in December 2014 that the thaw in relations was a \"manifestation of the failures of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy\" that \"will be remembered as a tragic mistake\".[238]\nIn July 2018, Cruz spoke at the Rally for Religious Freedom in Asia. Cruz said, \"'It is a pleasure to be here and stand in solidarity for the men and women across this globe who have been persecuted by communists... We must stand united, in shining light, in highlighting heroism, in highlighting courage, in speaking out for those like my family, like so many millions across the globe who've seen the jackboot of communism firsthand.'\"[239]\nCruz has called for an end to \"overcriminalization, harsh mandatory minimum sentences, and the demise of jury trials\".[240] He supports the death penalty.[241] In his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz frequently mentioned his role as counsel for the State of Texas in Medell\u00edn v. Texas, a 2008 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that Texas has the legal right to ignore an order from the International Court of Justice directing the U.S. to review the convictions and sentences of dozens of Mexican nationals on death row.[242] Cruz has referred to Medell\u00edn as the most important case of his tenure as Texas solicitor general.[242]\nCruz is a gun-rights supporter,[243] and opposes expanding gun control regulations.[244]\nIn an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt discussing the attack that killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Cruz said that \"the simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats\", and that the reason Democrats are soft on crime, is that convicted felons tend to vote Democratic.[245]\nIn August 2015, in the wake of the ambush death of a Texas police officer who was gunned down while filling up at a gas station, Cruz said that police are \"feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down, as we see \u2013 whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response from senior officials, the President or the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That's wrong. It's fundamentally wrong. It's endangering all of our safety and security.\"[246]\nCruz opposes the legalization of marijuana, but believes it should be decided at the state level.[247] Following the legalization of marijuana in Colorado he stated that, \"If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I personally don't agree with it, but that's their right.\"[248]\nCruz has been described by the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies as a \"free trader\"[249] and as a \"free-trade advocate\" by The Wall Street Journal.[250] In 2013, Cruz proposed the abolition of the IRS and the implementation of a flat tax \"where the average American can fill out taxes on a postcard\".[251] Cruz is \"adamantly opposed to a higher minimum wage\".[252]\nCruz wants to decrease the size of the government significantly. In addition to eliminating the IRS as described above, he has promised to eliminate four other cabinet-level agencies. Cruz proposes to eliminate the Department of Energy, the Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.[253]\nCruz is a proponent of school choice[254] and opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative.[255]\nCruz rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[256][257] He has said that \"the scientific evidence doesn't support global warming\".[258] He has also stated: \"They call anyone who questions the science who even points to the satellite data \u2013 they call you a, quote, 'denier'. Denier is not the language of science. Denier is the language of religion. It is heretic. You are a blasphemer. It's treated as a theology. But it's about power and money. At the end of the day, it's not complicated. This is liberal politicians who want government power.\"[258] In March 2015, he said that some people are \"global warming alarmists\" and, citing satellite temperature measurements, said that there had been no significant warming in 18 years.[257][258][259]\nCruz voted against the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 that would have created the National Endowment for the Oceans and authorized more than $26 billion in projects to be built by the Army Corps of Engineers, at least $16 billion of which would have come from federal taxpayers.[260][261] Cruz voted against the bill because it neglected \"to reduce a substantial backlog of projects, to the detriment of projects with national implications, such as the Sabine\u2013Neches Waterway\".[262] Cruz stated that the Corps' responsibilities were expanded without providing adequate measures for state participation.[262] Proponents of the bill argued that it would provide steady funding to support research and restoration projects, funded primarily by dedicating 12.5% of revenues from offshore energy development, including oil, gas, and renewable energy, through offshore lease sales and production based royalty payments, distributed through a competitive grant program.[263]\nIn 2017, Cruz was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[264] to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Cruz has received more than $2.5 million in campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.[265] Cruz has a lifetime score of 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters.[266]\nCruz is a supporter of TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline,[267] and along with every other Republican senator was a cosponsor of legislation in support of the pipeline.[268]\nIn a 2014 opinion editorial in USA Today, Cruz wrote that auditing the Federal Reserve System was a top Republican priority in 2015 and that he supported legislation that would allow the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, whose confirmation Cruz had tried to prevent, said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed any audit of the Federal Reserve and that \"For 50 years Congress has recognized that there should be an exception to GAO ability to audit the Fed to avoid any political interference in monetary policy.\"[269][270]\nIn 2015, Cruz voted in favor of the USA Freedom Act, which reauthorized the USA Patriot Act but reformed some of its provisions.[271][272]\nCruz has been an adamant opponent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the U.S. and other world powers, calling it \"catastrophic\" and \"disastrous\".[273][274]\nIn 2013, Cruz stated that America had no \"dog in the fight\" during the Syrian Civil War and stated that America's armed forces should not serve as \"al-Qaeda's air force\".[275] In 2014, Cruz criticized the Obama administration: \"The president's foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS, indeed, was working to arm Syrian rebels that were fighting side by side with ISIS\", calling ISIS \"the face of evil\". In a statement opposing US intervention for regime change in Syria, Cruz said, \"If President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Sen. Rubio succeed in toppling [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, the result will be the radical Islamic terrorists will take over Syria, that Syria will be controlled by ISIS, and that is materially worse for U.S. national security interests.\"[276]\nIn September 2016, Cruz backed the Obama administration's plan to sell more than $1.15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[277]\nIn early January 2017, Cruz, along with Texas governor Greg Abbott and some others met with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen. Cruz criticized the People's Republic of China after it reportedly made a statement asking members of Congress not to meet with Tsai.[278][279][280]\nOn January 5, 2017, Cruz voted in favor of a House resolution condemning UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[281]\nIn June 2017, Cruz co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[282][283]\nIn August 2018, Cruz and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China's Xinjiang region.[284] They wrote: \"The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in \"political reeducation\" centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.\"[285]\nOn December 18, 2018, Cruz and Senator Tom Cotton put forth a resolution in the U.S. Senate urging the United States to affirm Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.[286]\nCruz is a strong critic of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA or \"Obamacare\"). He has sponsored legislation that would repeal the health care reform law and its amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Cruz was part of the group of 13 Senators that drafted the Senate version of the AHCA behind closed doors.[287][288][289][290]\nIn 2013, Cruz voted against the bill to provide a package of federal aid to the East Coast for recovery from Hurricane Sandy.[291] Cruz said that he did not vote for Sandy disaster relief because the bill was \"filled with unrelated pork\" and that \"two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy\". The Washington Post disputed this, writing \"The bill was largely aimed at dealing with Sandy, along with relatively minor items to address other or future disasters.\"[292] The New York Times wrote that \"Of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one \u2014 $195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services \u2014 were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required.\"[293]\nIn 2015, in the wake of fatal flooding in Texas, Cruz supported federal aid funding; in 2017, he called for federal intervention as Hurricane Harvey approached the coast of Texas.[294]\nCruz adopted a \"hard-line stance\" on immigration issues during the 2014 border crisis[295] and is an opponent of comprehensive immigration reform.[43][295] Cruz advocates for an increase from 65,000 to 325,000 annually in skilled foreign workers entering the United States using H-1B visas.[296]\nAccording to McClatchy, Cruz staked out \"hard-right immigration stances\" during his 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination for President.[297]\nCruz opposes providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children (so-called DREAMers).[298] In February 2018, he was the sole Senator to oppose a Republican motion to begin debate on legislation intended to resolve the question of what to do with DREAMers.[299]\nCruz has called for the repeal of the clause of the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the United States.[300]\nCruz defended the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents.[301][302] Cruz blamed the migrant parents for crossing the US border to seek asylum and argued that the Obama administration had the same policy.[301][302]\nCruz opposes net neutrality\u2014which prevents Internet service providers from deliberately blocking or slowing particular websites\u2014arguing that the Internet economy has flourished in the United States simply because it has remained largely free from government regulation.[303] Cruz has argued that net neutrality is the \"Obamacare for the internet\".[304][305] Cruz said that the Obama-era implementation of the principle of net neutrality had the \"end result\" of \"less broadband, less innovation, and less freedom for the American consumer\".[305] In December 2017, after the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality, Cruz mocked supporters of net neutrality as \"snowflakes\" who were misled by \"online propaganda\".[306]\nOn abortion, Cruz is \"strongly pro-life\" and \"would allow the procedure only when a pregnancy endangers the mother's life\".[307][308] He is in favor of cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.[309]\nCruz opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[310] He believes that marriage should be legally defined as only \"between one man and one woman\",[311] but believes that the legality of same-sex marriage should be left to each state to decide.[312] Cruz referred to the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide as \"among the darkest hours of our nation\" and accused the court of judicial activism.[313]\nCruz married Heidi Nelson on May 27, 2001;[314] they have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine.[315] The couple met when Cruz was working on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Heidi took leave from her position as head of the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in 2016 to support Ted Cruz's run for the U.S. president.[316] She previously worked in the White House for Condoleezza Rice and in New York as an investment banker.[317]\nCruz has joked, \"I'm Cuban, Irish, and Italian, and yet somehow I ended up Southern Baptist.\"[318] He loves to wear cowboy boots, but he refrained from doing so when arguing before the Rehnquist court.[319]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nEmmanuel Jean-Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Macron (French:\u00a0[eman\u0265\u025bl \u0292\u0251\u0303 mi\u0283\u025bl f\u0281ede\u0281ik mak\u0281\u0254\u0303]; born 21 December 1977) is a French politician who has been President of France and ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra since 14 May 2017. Born in Amiens, Macron studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, later completing a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and graduating from the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an investment banker at Rothschild & Co. Macron was appointed a deputy secretary general by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande shortly after his election in May 2012, making Macron one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was later appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of the Economy and Industry in August 2014 by Prime Minister Manuel Valls. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned from the Cabinet in August 2016, launching a campaign for the 2017 presidential election. Although Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of a centrist political movement he founded in April 2016, En Marche. Though initially behind in opinion polls, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen. He quickly appointed \u00c9douard Philippe as prime minister, and in the legislative elections a month later, Macron's party, renamed \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. At the age of 39, Macron became the youngest president in French history. Born in Amiens, Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Macron is the son of Fran\u00e7oise Macron (n\u00e9e Nogu\u00e8s), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron, professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced in 2010. Macron has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979 and Estelle, born in 1982. Fran\u00e7oise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3] The Macron family legacy is traced back to the village of Authie in Hauts-de-France.[4] One of Macron's paternal great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine Nogu\u00e8s (n\u00e9e Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre, Gascony.[7] Macron commonly visited Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother Germaine, whom he called \"Manette\".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of reading[9] and his left-ward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother, became a teacher then a principal, and died in 2013.[10] Although raised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptized a Roman Catholic by his own request at age 12; he is agnostic today.[11] He was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute Lyc\u00e9e la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his last year of school[14] at the elite Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a \"Bac S, Mention Tr\u00e8s bien\". At the same time he was nominated for the \"Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" (most selective national level high school competition) in French literature and received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His parents sent him off to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with Brigitte Auzi\u00e8re, a married teacher with three children at J\u00e9suites de la Providence, who later became his wife.[16] In Paris, he failed to gain entry to the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure twice.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La D\u00e9fense, obtaining a DEA degree (a master level degree, with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel).[12][20] Around 1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, La M\u00e9moire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22] Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine Esprit.[23] Macron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last year when service was mandatory.[24] Macron obtained a master's degree in public affairs at the Sciences Po, majoring in \"Public Guidance and Economy\" before training for a senior civil service career at the selective \u00c9cole nationale d'administration (ENA), training at an embassy in Nigeria[25] and in an office in Oise before graduating in 2004.[26] After graduating from ENA in 2004, Macron became an Inspector in the Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (IGF), a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the then-head of the IGF.[27] During his time as an Inspector of Finances, Macron gave lectures during the summer at the \"prep'ENA\" (a special cram school for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP (fr), an elite private school specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the Grandes \u00e9coles, such as HEC or Sciences Po.[28][29][30] In 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him the job of managing director for Mouvement des Entreprises de France, the largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[31] In August 2007, Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's \"Commission to Unleash French Growth\".[13] In 2008, Macron paid \u20ac50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract.[32] He then became an investment banker in a highly-paid position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[33][34] In March 2010, he was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[35] In September 2008, Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[36] Macron was inspired to leave the government due to the election of Nicolas Sarkozy to the presidency. He was originally offered the job by Fran\u00e7ois Henrot. His first responsibility at Rothschild & Cie Banque was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis by Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Nord Europe.[37] Macron formed a relationship with Alain Minc, a businessman on the supervisory board of Le Monde.[38] In 2010, Macron was promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of Le Monde and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[39] In the same year, Macron was appointed as managing director and put in charge of Nestl\u00e9's acquisition of one of Pfizer's largest subsidiaries based around baby drinks. His share of the fees on this \u20ac9 billion deal made Macron a millionaire.[40] In February 2012, he advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of the Avril Group.[41] Macron reported that he had earned \u20ac2 million between December 2010 and May 2012.[42] Official documents show that between 2009 and 2013, Macron had earned almost \u20ac3 million.[43] He left Rothschild & Cie in 2012.[44] In his youth, Macron worked for the Citizen and Republican Movement for two years but he never applied to be a member.[45][42] Macron was an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during his time at Sciences Po.[46] Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party since he was 24 but he only renewed his subscription to the party from 2006 to 2009.[47][48][49] Macron met Fran\u00e7ois Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and joined his staff in 2010.[48] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007 legislative elections, however his application was declined.[50] Macron was offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon in 2010 though he declined.[51] On 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy secretary general of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, a senior role in President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's staff.[52][26] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the secretary general, Pierre-Ren\u00e9 Lemas. During the summer of 2012, Macron put forward a proposal that would increase the 35 hour work week to 37 hours until 2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[53] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary general of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e who he was serving with, opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact. Revel generally worked on social policy.[54] Macron was one of the deciding voices on not regulating the salaries of CEO's.[55] On 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[56] Reasons for his departure were that he was disappointed to not be included in the first Government of Manuel Valls and also frustrated by his lack of influence in the reforms proposed by the government.[54] This was following the appointment of Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[57] Jouyet said that Macron left to \"continue personal aspirations\"[58] and create his own financial consultancy firm.[59] It was later reported that Macron was planning to create an investment firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[45] Macron was shortly afterwards employed at the University of Berlin with the help of businessman, Alain Minc. Macron was awarded the position of research fellow. Macron had also sought a position at Harvard University.[60] Macron was offered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his hometown of Amiens. He declined the offer.[61] Manuel Valls attempted to appoint Macron as the Budget Minister but Fran\u00e7ois Hollande rejected the idea due to Macron never being elected before.[57] He was appointed as the Minister of Economy and Finance in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud Montebourg.[62] He was the youngest Minister of the Economy since Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing in 1962.[63] Macron was branded by the media as the \"Anti-Montebourg\" due to being pro-EU and much more moderate, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and left wing.[64] As Minister of the Economy, Macron was at the forefront of pushing through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using the special 49.3 procedure.[65] Macron increased the French share in the company Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the Florange law which grants double voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of shareholders vote to overturn it.[66] This gave the French state a minority share in the company though Macron later stated that the government will limit its powers within Renault.[67] Macron was widely criticised for being unable to prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Is\u00e8re.[68] In August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an independent.[69] The \"Macron Law\" was Macron's signature law package that was eventually pushed through parliament using the 49.3 procedure.[65] After the \"Law on Growth and Purchasing Power\" brought on by Arnaud Montebourg with the aim to \"restore 6 billion euros of purchasing power\" to the French public.[70] Macron presented the Macron Law to a council of ministers. The law intended to rejuvenate the French economy by fixing regulations based around Sunday work, transport and driving licenses, public sector jobs and the transport market.[71] Manuel Valls, under the fear that the law would not find a majority in the National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3 procedure.[72] The law was adopted on 10 April 2015.[73] The OECD estimated that the Macron Law would generate a \"0.3% increase in GDP over five-years and a 0.4% increase over 10-years\"[74] Ludovic Subran, the chief economist at credit insurance company, Euler Hermes, estimated that Macron Law would give France a GDP increase of 0.5%.[75] Macron first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV programme \"Des Paroles Et Des Actes\" in March 2015.[76] Before forming his political party En marche, Macron had hosted a series of events with him speaking in public, his first one in March 2015 in Val-de-Marne.[77] Macron threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government over the proposed reform on removing dual-nationality from terrorists.[78][79] He also took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the advancement of digital technology.[80] Tensions around the question of Macron's loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande himself increased when Hollande and Valls turned down a proposal for a law put forward by Macron. The law, titled \"Macron 2\" was going to be much bigger than the original Macron law with a larger aim of making the French economy competitive.[81][82] Macron was given the chance to insert his opinion into the El Khomri law and put specific parts of \"Macron 2\" into the law though El Khomri could overturn these with help of other ministers. Amid tensions and deterioration of relations with the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[83] A liberal,[84] progressive[85][86] political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first established,[87] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was raised.[88][89] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[90] though the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En marche including Manuel Valls,[91] Michel Sapin,[92] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[93] In June 2016, support for Macron and his movement, En marche, began to grow in the media with L'Express, Les Echos, Le 1 and L'Opinion beginning to voice public support for Macron.[94] Following several controversies surrounding trade unionists and their protests, major newspapers began to run stories about Macron and En marche on their front page with mainly positive press.[95] This was criticised hugely by the far-left in France and the far-right with the term \"Macronite\" being coined to describe the pro-Macron influence within the press.[96][97][98] The term has been expanded among the left-wing to also criticise the centrist leanings of most newspapers and their influence among left wing voter bases.[99][100][101] Macron was invited to attend a festival in Orl\u00e9ans by mayor Olivier Carr\u00e9 in May 2016, the festival is organised every year to celebrate Orl\u00e9ans' liberation by Joan of Arc.[102] France Info and LCI reported that Macron had attached the Republican values of the Fifth Republic to Joan of Arc and then in a speech, he compared himself to Joan of Arc.[103][104] Macron later went Puy du Fou and declared he was \"not a socialist\" in a speech amid rumours he was going to leave the current government.[105] On 30 August 2016, Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential election,[106][107] to devote himself to his En marche movement.[108][109] There had been rising tensions and several reports that he wanted to leave the Valls government since early 2015.[110] Macron initially planned to leave after the cancellation of his \"Macron 2\" law[82] but after a meeting with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he decided to stay and an announcement was planned to declare that Macron was committed to the government[111] (though the announcement was pushed back due to the 2016 Nice Attack and 2016 Normandy church attack[112][113]). Michel Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement.[114] Speaking on Macron's resignation, Hollande said he had been \"betrayed\".[115] According to an IFOP poll, 84% of French agreed with Macron's decision to resign.[116] Macron first showed intention to run with the formation of En marche but following his resignation from the government, he was able to spend more time dedicating himself to his movement. He first announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016[117] and after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began to find patterns in Macron's fundraising and typical presidential campaign fundraising tactics.[118] On 16 November 2016, Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of speculation. In his announcement speech, Macron called for a \"democratic revolution\" and promised to \"unblock France\".[119] Macron had wished that Hollande would join the race several months beforehand, saying that Hollande was the legitimate candidate for the Socialist Party.[120][121] A book was published on 24 November 2016 by Macron to support his campaign titled \"R\u00e9volution\", the book sold nearly 200,000 copies during its printing run and was one of the best selling books in France during 2016.[122][123][124] Shortly after announcing his run, Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the Socialist Party presidential primary though Macron ultimately refused.[125][126] Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis began to threaten to exclude members who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor G\u00e9rard Collomb's declaration of support for Macron.[127] Macron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci, announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in donations without public funding (as En marche was not a registered political party).[128][129] This was three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Jupp\u00e9.[130] Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Beno\u00eet Hamon who requested Macron reveal a list of his donors accusing him of conflicts of interest due to Macron's past at Rothschilds.[131] Macron replied to this, calling Hamon's behavior \"demagogic.\"[132] It was later reported by journalists Marion L'Hour and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Says that Macron had spent \u20ac120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various personalities within the media and in French popular culture while he was minister.[133][134][135] Macron was then accused by deputies, Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier of using this money to further the representation of En Marche in French political life.[136][137] Michel Sapin, his successor and Minister of Economy saw nothing illegal about Macron's actions saying that Macron had the right to spend the funds.[138] Macron said in response to these allegations that it was \"defamatory\" and that none of the ministerial budget had been spent on his party.[134] Macron's campaign enjoyed considerable coverage from the media.[139][140][141][142][143] Mediapart reported that Macron had over fifty magazine covers dedicated purely to him compared to Melenchon's \"handful\" despite similar followings online and both having large momentum during the campaign.[144] Macron has been consistently labelled by the far-left and far-right as the \"media candidate\" and has been viewed as such in opinion polls.[145][146][147] He is friends with the owners of Le Monde[148] and Claude Perdiel the former owner of Nouvel Observateur.[149] Many observers have compared Macron's campaign to a product being sold[150] due to Maurice L\u00e9vy, a former CEO using marketing tactics to try to advance Macron's presidential ambitions.[151][152] The magazine Marianne has reported that BFMTV, whose owner is Patrick Drahi, has broadcast more coverage of Macron than all four main candidates combined,[153] Marianne has said this may be due to Macron's campaign having links with Drahi through a former colleague of Drahi, Bernard Mourad.[154][155] After a range of comparisons to centrist, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, Bayrou announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead form an electoral alliance with Macron which went into effect on 22 February 2017, and has since lasted with En marche and the Democratic Movement becoming allies in the National Assembly.[156][157] Following this, Macron's poll ratings began to rise and after several legal issues surrounding Fran\u00e7ois Fillon become publicized, Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front runner after polls shown him beating National Front candidate Marine Le Pen in the second round.[158][159] Macron attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his campaign; despite declaring in November, he had still not released a complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and concern among allies and supporters.[160] He eventually laid out his 150-page formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon press conference that day.[161] Macron accumulated a wide array of supporters, securing endorsements from Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy of the primary of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En marche, as well as numerous others \u2013 many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[162] The Grand Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[163] On 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the presidential election, with 24% of the overall vote and more than 8 million votes all together. He progressed to the second round with Marine Le Pen. Former candidates Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon voiced their support for Macron.[164] Macron qualified for the run-off against National Front candidate Marine Le Pen on 23 April 2017, after coming first place in the vote count. Following the announcement of his qualification, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon expressed support for Macron.[164] President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande also endorsed Macron.[165] Many foreign politicians voiced support for Macron in his bid against right-wing populist candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[166] and former US President Barack Obama.[167] A debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The debate lasted for 2 hours and Macron was considered the winner due to opinion polls.[168] In March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind \"high level attacks\" on Macron, and said that its state media are \"the first source of false information\". He said: \"We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our candidate\u00a0...\".[169] Two days before the French Presidential Election on 7 May, it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were then spread onto the imageboard 4chan which led to the hashtag \"#macronleaks\" trending on Twitter.[170][171] In a statement on the same evening, Macron's political movement, En marche, said: \"The En marche movement has been the victim of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information\".[172] Macron's campaign had been presented a report before in March 2017 by the Japanese cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En marche had been the target of phishing attacks.[173] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks were Russian hacking group Fancy Bear who were also accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee on 22 July 2016.[173] These same emails were verified and released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[174] This was following Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[175] On 7 May 2017, Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote compared to Marine Le Pen's 33.9%. The election had record absention at 25.4% and 8% of ballots being blank or spoilt.[176] Macron resigned from his role as president of En marche[177] and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[178] Macron qualified for the runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second round of the presidential election on 7 May by a landslide according to preliminary results,[179] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, concede.[180] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[181][182][183] He is also the first president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958. Macron formally became president on 14 May.[184] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as his chief of staff[185] and Isma\u00ebl Emelien as his special advisor for strategy, communication and speeches.[186] On 15 May, he appointed \u00c9douard Philippe of the Republicans as Prime Minister.[187][188] On the same day, he made his first official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France\u2013Germany relations to the European Union.[189] They agreed to draw up a \"common road map\" for Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the European Union.[190] In the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La R\u00e9publique en marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[191] After The Republicans emerged as the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner stated the elections were a \"failure\" for his party.[192] In his first few months as president, Macron pressed for enactment of package of reforms on public ethics, labor laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers. In response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning elected representatives from hiring family members.[193] Meanwhile, the second part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after Senate objections.[194] Macron's plan to give his wife an official role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from it being undemocratic to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[195] Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan.[196] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping the constituency funds.[197] Macron aims to shift union\u2013management relations away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and Scandinavia.[198][199] He has also pledged to act against companies employing cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French workers, what he has termed as \"social dumping\". Under the EU rules, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at the salary level in eastern European countries which has led to dispute between the EU states.[200] The French government announced the proposed changes to France's labour rules (\"Code du Travail\"), being among the first steps taken by Macron and his government to galvanise the French economy.[201] Macron's reform efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[202] The largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant CGT is more hostile to reforms.[198][199] Macron's labour minister, Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, is overseeing the effort.[203] The National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal, allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions and employers' groups.[204] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[205] Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the biggest since 2001.[206] On 23 June 2018, President Macron said: \"The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015\", \"A country like Italy has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis\".[207] In November 2019, Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees reaching France, while stating to \"take back control\u201d of the immigration policy.[208] Pierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies, stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[209] De Villiers cited the military budget cut of \u20ac850 million as the main reason he was stepping down. Le Monde later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary group, \"I will not let myself be fucked like this.\"[210] Macron named Fran\u00e7ois Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[211] Macron's government presented its first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[212] The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[213] Before it was replaced, the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global worth exceeded \u20ac1.3m.[214] In February 2017, Macron announced a plan to offer voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil service.[215] In December 2019, Macron informed that he would scrap 20th century Byzantine pension system and introduce a single nations pension system managed by the state.[216] In January 2019, after weeks of public transport shutdown and vandalization across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron compromised the plan by revising the retirement age.[217] In July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron. The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass the bill 415\u2013127, with 19 abstentions. Interior Minister G\u00e9rard Collomb described France as being \"still in a state of war\" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second reading by a 244\u201322 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13 terror plots had been foiled since 2017 began. The law replaced the state of emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[218] The bill was criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by Le Figaro showed 57% of the respondents approved it even though 62% thought it would encroach on personal freedoms.[219] The law gives authorities expanded power to search homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[220] and search areas around train stations as well as international ports and airports. It was passed after modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive measures will be reviewed annually and are scheduled to lapse by the end of 2020.[221] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October. He announced that, starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of emergency.[222] Speaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais Jungle, Macron said he would not allow another refugee camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration and asylum.[223] He announced plans to speed up asylum applications and deportations but give refugees better housing.[224] Visiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy when he rejected nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official language[225] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[226] Macron also proposed a plan to \"reorganise\" the Islamic religion in France saying: \"We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to explain it, which is extremely important \u2013 my goal is to rediscover what lies at the heart of la\u00efcit\u00e9, the possibility of being able to believe as not to believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having free consciousness.\" He declined to reveal further information about the plan.[227] Macron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake between the two of them being characterized as a \"power-struggle\".[228][229] On 29 May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik accusing the news agencies of being \"organs of influence and propaganda, of lying propaganda\".[230][231] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if chemical weapons are used.[232] In response to the chemical attack in Douma, Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United Kingdom.[233][234] In his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August, President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized Venezuela's government as a \"dictatorship\". He added that he would announce his new initiatives on the future of European Union after the German elections in September.[235] According to the IFOP poll for Le Journal du Dimanche, Macron started his five-year term with a 62 per cent approval rating.[236][237] This was higher than Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's popularity at the start of his first term (61 per cent) but lower than Sarkozy's (65 per cent).[238] An IFOP poll on 24 June 2017 said that 64 percent of French people were pleased with Macron's performance.[239] In the IFOP poll on 23 July 2017, Macron suffered a 10 percent point drop in popularity, the largest for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995.[240] 54 per cent of French people approved of Macron's performance[241] a 24 percentage point drop in three months.[242] The main contributors to this drop in popularity are his recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre De Villiers,[243] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore & Shipbuilding,[244] and the reduction in housing benefit.[245] In August 2017, IFOP polls stated that 40 per cent approved and 57 per cent disapproved of his performance.[246] By the end of September 2017, seven out of ten respondents said that they believe Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign promises,[247][248] though a majority felt that the policies the government was putting forward were \"unfair.\"[249] Macron's popularity fell sharply in 2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November. Dissatisfaction with his presidency has been expressed by protestors in the yellow vests movement.[250][251] On 18 July 2018, Le Monde revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15 days before only being internally demoted. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e failed to refer the case to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required under the code of criminal procedure.[252] Overall, Macron is largely seen as a centrist.[253][254][255][256][257][258] Some observers describe him as a social liberal[259][260][84][261][262] and others call him a social democrat.[263][264][265] During his time in the French Socialist Party, he supported the party's centrist wing,[266] whose political stance has been associated with \"third way\" policies advanced by Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and whose leading spokesman has been former prime minister Manuel Valls.[267][268][269][270] In the past, Macron has called himself a socialist,[271] but since August 2015, he has labelled himself as a centrist liberal. He has refused observations by critics that he is an \"ultra-liberal\" economically.[272][273][274][275] During a visit to Vendee in August 2016, he said he was not a socialist and that he just served in a \"left wing government.\"[276] He has called himself both left wing and liberal in his book R\u00e9volution.[277] Macron has since been labeled a libertarian with a socially liberal viewpoint.[278] Macron created the centrist political party En Marche with the attempt to create a party that can cross partisan lines.[279] Speaking on why he formed En marche, he said there is a real divide in France between \"conservatives and progressives\"[280] His political platform during the 2017 French Presidential Election contained stances from both the right wing and the left wing[281] which led to him being positioned as a \"radical centrist\" by Le Figaro.[282] Macron has rejected the term \"centrist\"[283] though political scientist Luc Rouban has compared his platform to former centrist president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, who is the only other French president to have been elected on a centrist platform.[284] Macron has been compared to former president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing due to their ability to win a presidential election on a centrist platform and for their similar governing styles. Both were inspectors of finance, were given responsibilities based around tax and revenue, both were very ambitious about running for the position of president, showing their keenness early in their careers and both were seen as figures of renewal in French political life.[285][286][287][288][289][290] d'Estaing even said himself in 2016 that he was \"a little like Macron.\"[291] Observers have noted that while they are alike ideologically, d'Estaing had ministerial experience and time in Parliament to show for his political life while Macron had never been elected before.[292] Macron has advocated in favour of the free market and reducing the public-finances deficit.[293] He first publicly used the term \"liberal\" to describe himself in a 2015 interview with Le Monde. He added that he is \"neither right nor left\" and that he advocates \"a collective solidarity\".[294][295] During a visit to the Puy du Fou in Vend\u00e9e with Philippe de Villiers in August 2016, he stated, \"Honesty compels me to say that I am not a socialist.\"[296] He explained that he was part of the \"left government\" because he wanted \"to serve the public interest\" as any minister would.[297] In his book R\u00e9volution, published in November 2016, Macron presents himself as both a \"leftist\" and a \"liberal\u00a0... if by liberalism one means trust in man.\"[298] With his party En marche, Macron's stated aim is to transcend the left\u2013right divide in a manner similar to Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou or Jacques Chaban-Delmas, asserting that \"the real divide in our country\u00a0... is between progressives and conservatives\". With the launch of his independent candidacy and his use of anti-establishment rhetoric, Macron has been labelled a \"populist\" by some observers, notably Manuel Valls, but Macron rejects this term.[299][300] Macron is a supporter of the El Khomri law. He became the most vocal proponent of the economic overhaul of the country.[301] Macron has stated that he wants to go further than the El Khomri law when reforming the Labor code.[302] Macron is in favor of tax cuts. During the 2017 Presidential Election, Macron proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 33.3% to 25%. Macron also wants to remove investment income from the wealth tax so that it is solely a tax on high-value property.[303] Macron also wants to exempt 18 million households from local residence tax, branding the tax as \"unfair\" during his 2017 presidential campaign.[304][305][306] Macron is against raising taxes on the highest earners. When asked about Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's proposal to raise income tax on the upper class to 75%, Macron compared the policy to the Cuban taxation system.[307] Macron supports stopping tax avoidance.[308] Macron has advocated for the end of the 35 hour work week;[309][310] however, his view has changed over time and he now seeks reforms that aim to preserve the 35 hour work week while increasing France's competitiveness.[311] He has said that he wants to return flexibility to companies without ending the 35 work week.[312] This would include companies renegotiating work hours and overtime payments with employees. Macron has supported cutting the amount of civil servants by 120,000.[313] Macron also supports spending cuts, saying he would cut 60 billion euros in public spending over a span of five years.[314] He has supported the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union and criticized the Walloon government for trying to block it.[315] He believes that CETA should not require the endorsement of national parliaments because \"it undermines the EU\".[316] Macron supports the idea of giving the Eurozone its own common budget.[317][318][314] Regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Macron stated in June 2016 that \"the conditions [to sign the treaty] are not met\", adding that \"we mustn't close the door entirely\" and \"need a strong link with the US\".[319] In April 2017, Macron called for a \"rebalancing\" of Germany's trade surplus, saying that \"Germany benefits from the imbalances within the Eurozone and achieves very high trade surpluses\".[320] In March 2018, Macron announced that the government would spend 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to boost innovation. The money would be used to sponsor research projects and scientific laboratories, as well as to finance startup companies within the country whose focus is AI.[321] Macron described France's colonization of Algeria as a \"crime against humanity\".[322][323] He also said: \"It's truly barbarous and it's part of a past that we need to confront by apologizing to those against whom we committed these acts.\"[324] Polls following his remarks reflected a decrease in his support.[322] Macron described the 2011 military intervention in Libya as a \"historic error\".[325] In 2012, Macron was a Young Leader with the French-American Foundation.[326] In January 2017, he said France needed a more \"balanced\" policy toward Syria, including talks with Bashar al-Assad.[327] In April 2017, following the chemical attack in Khan Shaykhun, Macron proposed a possible military intervention against the Assad regime, preferably under United Nations auspices.[328] He has warned if the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons during his presidency he will act unilaterally to punish it.[325] He supports the continuation of President Hollande's policies on Israel, opposes the BDS movement, and has refused to state a position on recognition of the State of Palestine.[329] In May 2018, Macron condemned \"the violence of Israeli armed forces\" against Palestinians in Gaza border protests.[330] He criticized the Franco-Swiss construction firm LafargeHolcim for competing to build the wall on the Mexico-United States border promised by U.S. President Donald Trump.[331] Macron has called for a peaceful solution during the 2017 North Korea crisis,[332] though he agreed to work with US President Trump against North Korea.[333] Macron and Trump apparently conducted a phone call on 12 August 2017 where they discussed confronting North Korea, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and enforcing new sanctions.[334] Macron condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He described the situation as \"genocide\" and \"ethnic purification\", and alluded to the prospect of UN-led intervention.[335] In response to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, Macron said that Turkey must respect Syria's sovereignty, despite his condemnation of Bashar al-Assad.[336] Macron has voiced support for the Saudi Arabian-led military campaign against Yemen's Shiite rebels.[337] He also defended France's arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition.[338] Some rights groups have argued that France is violating national and international law by selling weapons to members of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.[339][340] In response to the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of organ failure while in government custody, Macron praised Liu as \"a freedom fighter\". Macron also described as \"extremely fruitful and positive\" his first contacts with President Xi Jinping.[341] An article in the New York Times described Emmanuel Macron as \"ardently pro-Europe\" and stated that he \"has proudly embraced an unpopular European Union.\"[342] Macron was described by some as Europhile[343][344] and federalist[345][346] but he describes himself as \"neither pro-European, eurosceptic nor a federalist in the classical sense\",[347] and his party as \"the only pro-European political force in France\".[348] In June 2015, Macron and his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel published a platform advocating a continuation of European integration. They advocate the continuation \"of structural reforms (such as labor markets), institutional reforms (including the area of economic governance)\",[349] but also a reconciliation of 'tax and social systems (like better co-ordination or harmonization of the corporate taxes via, for example, minimum wages)\".[citation needed] He also advocates the creation of a post of the EU Commissioner that would be responsible for the Eurozone and Eurozone's Parliament and a common budget.[350] In addition, Macron stated: \"I'm in favor of strengthening anti-dumping measures which have to be faster and more powerful like those in the United States. We also need to establish a monitoring of foreign investments in strategic sectors at the EU level in order to protect a vital industry and to ensure our sovereignty and the European superiority.\"[294] Macron also stated that, if elected, he would seek to renegotiate the Treaty of Le Touquet with the United Kingdom which has caused a build-up of economic migrants in Calais. When Macron served as economy minister he had suggested the Treaty could be scrapped if the UK left the European Union.[351] On 1 May 2017, Macron said the EU needs to reform or face Frexit.[352] On 26 September, he unveiled his proposals for the EU, intending to deepen the bloc politically and harmonise its rules. He argued for institutional changes, initiatives to promote EU, along with new ventures in the technology, defence and energy sectors. His proposals also included setting up a rapid reaction force working along with national armies while establishing a finance minister, budget and parliament for the Eurozone. He also called for a new tax on technology giants, an EU-wide asylum agency to deal with the refugee crisis, and changes to the Common Agricultural Policy.[353] Following the declaration of independence by Catalonia, Macron joined the EU in supporting Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy.[354] In a conversation with BBC's Andrew Marr, Macron stated that theoretically if France should choose to withdraw from the EU, they would do so through a national popular vote.[355] In November 2019, Macron blocked EU accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia, proposing changes to EU Enlargement policy. In an interview with The Economist, Macron explained that the EU was too reliant on NATO and the US, and that it should initiate \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d with Russia.[356] After the European elections in 2019, it was Macron in particular who prevented the leading candidate of the European People's Party, Manfred Weber, as president of the European Commission. Previously it was a tradition that always the top candidate of the largest party took over this post. Critics accuse Macron of having ignored by his actions the democratic decision of the voters for power-political reasons, and thus sacrificed the democratic principles of his own interests.[357] In July 2015, as economy minister, Macron stated in an interview that any Greece bailout package must also ease their burden by including reductions in the country's overall debt.[358] In July 2015, while challenging the \"loaded question\" of the 2015 Greek referendum, Macron called for resisting the \"automatic ejection\" of Greece from the Eurozone and avoiding \"the Versailles Treaty of the Eurozone,\" in which case the \"No\" side would win. He believes that the Greek and European leaders co-produced the Greek government-debt crisis,[359] and that the agreement reached in summer 2015 between Greece and its creditors, notably driven by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will not help Greece in dealing with the debt, while at the same time criticizing the International Monetary Fund.[360] In June 2016, he criticized the austerity policies imposed on Greece, considering them to be unsustainable and calling for the joint establishment of \"fiscal and financial solidarity mechanisms\" and a mechanism for restructuring the debt of Eurozone member states.[360] Yanis Varoufakis, minister of finance in the First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras, praised Macron, calling him \"the only French Minister in the Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's administration that seemed to understand what was at stake in the Eurozone\" and who, according to him, \"tried to play the intermediary between us [Greece] and the troika of our creditors EC, IMF, ECB even if they don't allow him to play the role\".[361] President Macron supports NATO and its role in the security of eastern European states and he also said pressure NATO partners like Poland to uphold what he called \"European values\". He said in April 2017 that \"in the three months after I'm elected, there will be a decision on Poland. You cannot have a European Union which argues over every single decimal place on the issue of budgets with each country, and which, when you have an EU member which acts like Poland or Hungary on issues linked to universities and learning, or refugees, or fundamental values, decides to do nothing.\"[362] Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in response that Macron \"violated European standards and the principles of friendship with Poland\".[363] During a press conference with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles in May 2017, he condemned the Russian state media as \"lying propaganda.\"[364] At the same month, he said that \"we all know who Le Pen\u2019s allies are. The regimes of Orb\u00e1n, Kaczy\u0144ski, Putin. These aren\u2019t the regimes with an open and free democracy. Every day they break many democratic freedoms.\"[365] Macron said that the European Commission needs to do more to stop the influx of low-paid temporary workers from Central and Eastern Europe into France.[366] Unlike many French Socialists, including former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, Macron supports the open-door policy toward migrants from the Middle East and Africa pursued by Angela Merkel in Germany[367] and promotes tolerance towards immigrants and Muslims.[342] Macron has expressed confidence in France's ability to absorb more immigrants and welcomes their arrival into Europe, asserting that the influx will have a positive economic impact.[368] However, he believes that Frontex (the European Border and Coast Guard Agency) is \"not a sufficiently ambitious program\" and has called for more investment in coast and border guards, \"because anyone who enters [Europe] at Lampedusa or elsewhere is a concern for all European countries\".[316] In June 2018 the Aquarius (NGO ship) carrying 629 migrants that were rescued near Libya was denied entry to the Sicilian port by Italy's new interior minister Matteo Salvini.[369] Italian PM Giuseppe Conte accused France of hypocrisy after Macron said Italy was acting \"irresponsibly\" by refusing entry to migrants and suggested it had violated international maritime law.[370] Italy's deputy PM Luigi Di Maio said: \"I am happy the French have discovered responsibility\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they should open their ports and we will send a few people to France.\"[371] Macron believes that the proposed reform bill on deprivation of citizenship for French-born and naturalized citizens convicted on terrorism charges was not a \"concrete solution\" and believes that \"the endless prolongation of the state of emergency raises legitimate questions\". He advocates an increase in state funding of intelligence agencies.[372] Macron calls for a restoration of community policing and considers that \"the management of some major risks must be delegated to the associations' or the private sector\".[373] He considers that his proposal to provide each young adult a \"Culture Pass\" of \u20ac500 may encourage young people to discover the culture of France and deter terrorism.[374] Macron has endorsed proposals to make it mandatory for Internet companies to allow the government to access encrypted communications from customers.[375] Macron expressed deep regret at US President Trump's decision to take back U.S. armed forces from Syria.[376] In October 2019, Macron warned that Turkey would be responsible for helping Islamic State to re-establish a Caliphate in Syria as he called on Turkey to stop its military offensive against Kurdish forces the north of Syria.[377] Ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Macron called for acceleration of the ecological transition and advocated a \"balance between ecological imperatives and economic requirements\", an objective that the French government seeks to achieve by fighting on \"five fronts\": \"innovation\", \"simplification\", \"strengthening of our energy efficiency and [...] reduction of fossil fuel usage\", \"energy competitiveness\" and \"action in Europe and worldwide\".[378] During the summer of 2016, he defended the use of diesel fuel, which he believes there should not be a \"hunt\" for since it \"remains at the heart of the French industrial policy\". Macron expressed this opinion in the aftermath of the Volkswagen emissions scandal. He was then part of a Socialist-backed government; prominent members from that party, including Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, criticized that position.[379][380][381] In addition, Macron is in favor of using nuclear energy which he considers \"a French choice and a choice for the future\".[382] Nevertheless, in the multi-year energy program (programmation pluriannuelle de l'\u00e9nergie, PPE) Macron committed to reduce the use of nuclear energy in France by 2035.[383] In 2016, Macron proposed that France \"secures its supplies in the most strategic materials using three levers: the circular economy and the recovery of materials contained in the end of life of the products [...]; the diversification of supplies to overcome geopolitical risks [...] and to bring more competitiveness; the creation of new reasonably-sized mines in France, while following the best social and environmental standards\".[384] Although he is sceptical about the construction of the A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest, Macron stated he believed the construction should start since the people backed the project in the 2016 local referendum. However, after Macron's inauguration, Prime Minister Philippe said that the plans for construction would be abandoned.[385] He criticised Donald Trump for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord on 2 June 2017, and called for scientists to come to France in order to work together on climate change.[386] In 2018, Macron announced that France would commit 700 million euros to the International Solar Alliance, a treaty-based alliance to expand solar power infrastructure.[387] In the same year, Macron announced that France would phase out coal power, with the target of shutting down all coal-fired power stations (which make up about 1% of French energy generation) by 2021.[388] In 2018, he pursued a petrol tax, albeit, the tax stems from an earlier policy under his predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.[389] A burgeoning grassroots movement, the Gilets jaunes protests developed throughout France in November and December, extending even to the overseas territory of R\u00e9union. On 4 December, Prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe announced that the tax increase would be pushed back six months.[390] The following day however, Macron scrapped the fuel tax increase altogether.[391] On January 13, 2019, he penned a 2,300-word letter[392] addressing the nation in response to 9 consecutive weeks of protests by the Gilets Jaunes movement, calling for 3 months of national debate to address grievances.[393] Macron called the 2019 Brazil wildfires an \"international crisis\" as the Amazon rainforest produces \"20% of the world's oxygen.\"[394] Macron stated he will refuse to ratify the EU\u2013Mercosur Free Trade Agreement unless Brazil commits to protecting the environment.[395] Macron supports the principle of secularism (la\u00efcit\u00e9). He also said that \"we have a duty to let everybody practice their religion with dignity\".[396] In July 2016, at the first meeting of En marche, Macron expressed opposition to banning Muslim headscarves in universities, stating, \"Personally, I do not believe we should be inventing new texts, new laws, new standards, in order to hunt down veils at universities and go after people who wear religious symbols during field trips.\"[397] In an interview with the French news magazine Marianne, Macron asserted that \"secularism is not designed to promote a republican religion\", and responded to comments by Manuel Valls and Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement regarding the practice of Islam in French society by condemning the notion that citizens should be \"discreet\" in their religious practice, stating that \"historical precedents when we asked for discretion in matters of religion did not bring honor to the Republic.\"[398] In the same interview, Macron said of French Muslims, \"I ask one thing: absolutely respect the rules while in public. Religious relationships are about transcendence, and I am not asking people to be moderate \u2013 that's not what I'm arguing. My own deep conviction is that a practising Catholic may believe that the laws of his religion go far beyond the laws of the Republic. I simply believe that when one enters the public realm, the laws of the Republic must prevail over religious law.\" He also condemned \"religious schools that teach hatred towards the Republic, with instruction mainly in Arabic or, in other instances, which teach the Torah more than basic fundamentals.\"[398] This statement triggered an intense negative reaction from the Fonds Social Juif Unifi\u00e9 (FSJU), an organization that runs Jewish religious schools in France.[399] Regarding support for Macron from religious groups, Jean-Dominique Durand\u2014an expert on the history of contemporary Christianity and a deputy mayor of Lyon\u2014said to The Washington Post: \"What we have now is silence from the bishops. Protestants, Muslims, Jews have all mobilized for Macron. Not the Catholics, not in any clear way.\" Macron supports stopping what he calls the \"compartmentalisation of healthcare\" by allowing private practitioners into public hospitals.[400] Macron also supports investing money in medical science to develop new technology and find better ways to treat patients.[401] Macron advocates for national health insurance covering optics, hearing and dentalcare.[402] According to Les Echos, extending national health insurance coverage to optics, hearing and dentalcare would cost \u20ac4.4 billion a year.[403] Macron supports giving more autonomy to schools and universities.[404][405] Macron wants to create a programme that forces schools to pay experienced teachers higher salaries and give them more educational freedom.[404] Macron wants to combat the issue of income inequality in schools by attempting to improve working-class schools and providing incentives to more well-off children as a way to persuade them into attending working-class schools.[404] Macron wants to make vocational education a priority. He has referred to Germany's system as one that his government would follow when putting forward measures relating to vocational education.[406] In July 2017, while at a ceremony at the site of the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver where 13,000 Jews had been rounded up for deportation to death camps in July 1942, Macron denounced his country's role in the Holocaust and the historical revisionism that denied France's responsibility for the 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup and the eventual deportation of 76,000 Jews. Earlier that year, Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front, had stated in speeches that the government during WWII \"was not France\".[407][408] \"It was indeed France that organised this [roundup]\", Macron said, French police collaborating with the Nazis. \"Not a single German took part,\" he added. Previous president Jacques Chirac had already stated that the Government during the War represented the French State.[409] Macron further stated: \"It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it's convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie.\"[410][411] Macron made a subtle reference to Chirac's 1995 apology when he added, \"I say it again here. It was indeed France that organized the roundup, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.\"[412][413] In his speech condemning the historical collaboration of France with the Nazis, Macron also termed anti-Zionism as a new form of antisemitism. While addressing Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, Macron stated that \"we will never surrender to the messages of hate; we will not surrender to anti-Zionism because it is a reinvention of anti-Semitism.\"[414] He also drew parallels between antisemitism in the past and present. He stated, \"You only need to stop for a moment,\" adding, \"to see, behind the new fa\u00e7ade, the racism of old, the entrenched vein of anti-Semitism.\"[415] In November 2018 he referred to nationalism as the \"exact opposite\" of patriotism, and a betrayal of it, characterizing nationalism as \"who cares about others\".[416] This prompted criticism that his definition was wrong.[417][418] Macron is accused by members of the Yellow vests of being an \"ultra-liberal president for the rich\".[419] As President of France, Macron also serves ex officio as one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. His chief of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity. Macron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[420] 24 years his senior,[421] who was a teacher in his high school, La Providence High School in Amiens.[422][423] They met during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student and she was a 39-year-old teacher, but they only became a couple once he was 18.[424][425] His parents initially attempted to separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][425] However, the couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[425] She has three children from a previous marriage, but Macron has no children of his own.[426] Trogneux's role in Macron's 2017 presidential campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that Trogneux assisted Macron with developing skills such as public speaking.[427] His best man was Henry Hermand (1924\u20132016), a businessman who loaned \u20ac550,000 to Macron for the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances. Hermand also let Macron use some of his offices on the Avenue des Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris for his movement En marche.[428][429] In the 2002 French presidential election, Macron voted for souverainist Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement.[430] In 2007, Macron voted for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal in the second round of the presidential election.[431] During the Socialist Party primary in 2011, Macron voiced his support for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.[432] He is also a pianist,[433] having studied piano for ten years in his youth,[15] and especially enjoys the work of Schumann and Liszt.[434][435] Macron also skis,[436] plays tennis[437] and enjoys boxing.[438] In addition to his native French, Macron also speaks fluent English.[439][440] One of his great-grandfathers was an Englishman from Bristol.[441] In August 2017, a photojournalist was arrested and detained by the police for six hours after he entered the private residence where Macron was vacationing in Marseille.[442] Macron subsequently filed a complaint for \"harassment.\"[442] In September 2017, he dropped the complaint \"as a gesture of appeasement.\"[443] On 27 August 2017, President Macron and his wife Brigitte adopted Nemo, a black Labrador Retriever-Griffon dog who lives with them in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.[444] As a schoolboy, Macron took the decision to be baptized as a Catholic. In June 2018, prior to meeting Pope Francis, he identified himself as an Agnostic Catholic.[445][446] In the same year he accepted being made an honorary canon of St John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome.[447] A fan of association football, Macron is a supporter of French club Olympique de Marseille.[448] During the 2018 World Cup, he attended the semi-final between France and Belgium with the Belgian King Philippe and Queen Mathilde.[449] At the World Cup final against Croatia, Macron sat and celebrated alongside Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107. Macron's celebrations, reactions, and interactions with the Croatian president drew widespread media attention,[450][451] slightly lifting both leaders' approval ratings.[452][453] Photos of Macron celebrating France's victory went viral on social media, with images of him standing on a table, kissing the World Cup trophy, and standing in rainfall hugging French players circulating through international press.[454][455] Macron's affectionate embraces of Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 also went viral on social media[456][457] with the two leaders parodied as an enamored couple.[458][459]",

He worked as a senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an investment banker at Rothschild &amp; Co.\nMacron was appointed a deputy secretary general by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande shortly after his election in May 2012, making Macron one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was later appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of the Economy and Industry in August 2014 by Prime Minister Manuel Valls. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned from the Cabinet in August 2016, launching a campaign for the 2017 presidential election. Although Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of a centrist political movement he founded in April 2016, En Marche.\nThough initially behind in opinion polls, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen. He quickly appointed \u00c9douard Philippe as prime minister, and in the legislative elections a month later, Macron's party, renamed \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. At the age of 39, Macron became the youngest president in French history.\nBorn in Amiens, Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Macron is the son of Fran\u00e7oise Macron (n\u00e9e Nogu\u00e8s), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron, professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced in 2010. Macron has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979 and Estelle, born in 1982. Fran\u00e7oise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3]\nThe Macron family legacy is traced back to the village of Authie in Hauts-de-France.[4] One of Macron's paternal great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6]  His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine Nogu\u00e8s (n\u00e9e Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre, Gascony.[7] Macron commonly visited Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother Germaine, whom he called \"Manette\".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of reading[9] and his left-ward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother, became a teacher then a principal, and died in 2013.[10]\nAlthough raised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptized a Roman Catholic by his own request at age 12; he is agnostic today.[11]\nHe was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute Lyc\u00e9e la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his last year of school[14] at the elite Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a \"Bac S, Mention Tr\u00e8s bien\". At the same time he was nominated for the \"Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" (most selective national level high school competition) in French literature and received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His parents sent him off to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with Brigitte Auzi\u00e8re, a married teacher with three children at J\u00e9suites de la Providence, who later became his wife.[16]\nIn Paris, he failed to gain entry to the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure twice.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La D\u00e9fense, obtaining a DEA degree (a master level degree, with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel).[12][20] Around 1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, La M\u00e9moire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22] Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine Esprit.[23]\nMacron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last year when service was mandatory.[24]\nMacron obtained a master's degree in public affairs at the Sciences Po, majoring in \"Public Guidance and Economy\" before training for a senior civil service career at the selective \u00c9cole nationale d'administration (ENA), training at an embassy in Nigeria[25] and in an office in Oise before graduating in 2004.[26]\nAfter graduating from ENA in 2004, Macron became an Inspector in the Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (IGF), a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the then-head of the IGF.[27] During his time as an Inspector of Finances, Macron gave lectures during the summer at the \"prep'ENA\" (a special cram school for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP (fr), an elite private school specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the Grandes \u00e9coles, such as HEC or Sciences Po.[28][29][30]\nIn 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him the job of managing director for Mouvement des Entreprises de France, the largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[31]\nIn August 2007, Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's \"Commission to Unleash French Growth\".[13] In 2008, Macron paid \u20ac50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract.[32] He then became an investment banker in a highly-paid position at Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque.[33][34] In March 2010, he was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[35]\nIn September 2008, Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque.[36] Macron was inspired to leave the government due to the election of Nicolas Sarkozy to the presidency. He was originally offered the job by Fran\u00e7ois Henrot. His first responsibility at Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis by Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Nord Europe.[37]\nMacron formed a relationship with Alain Minc, a businessman on the supervisory board of Le Monde.[38] In 2010, Macron was promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of Le Monde and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[39] In the same year, Macron was appointed as managing director and put in charge of Nestl\u00e9's acquisition of one of Pfizer's largest subsidiaries based around baby drinks. His share of the fees on this \u20ac9 billion deal made Macron a millionaire.[40]\nIn February 2012, he advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of the Avril Group.[41]\nMacron reported that he had earned \u20ac2 million between December 2010 and May 2012.[42] Official documents show that between 2009 and 2013, Macron had earned almost \u20ac3 million.[43] He left Rothschild &amp; Cie in 2012.[44]\nIn his youth, Macron worked for the Citizen and Republican Movement for two years but he never applied to be a member.[45][42] Macron was an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during his time at Sciences Po.[46] Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party since he was 24 but he only renewed his subscription to the party from 2006 to 2009.[47][48][49]\nMacron met Fran\u00e7ois Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and joined his staff in 2010.[48] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007 legislative elections, however his application was declined.[50] Macron was offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon in 2010 though he declined.[51]\nOn 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy secretary general of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, a senior role in President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's staff.[52][26] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the secretary general, Pierre-Ren\u00e9 Lemas.\nDuring the summer of 2012, Macron put forward a proposal that would increase the 35 hour work week to 37 hours until 2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[53] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary general of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e who he was serving with, opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact. Revel generally worked on social policy.[54]\nMacron was one of the deciding voices on not regulating the salaries of CEO's.[55]\nOn 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[56] Reasons for his departure were that he was disappointed to not be included in the first Government of Manuel Valls and also frustrated by his lack of influence in the reforms proposed by the government.[54] This was following the appointment of Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[57]\nJouyet said that Macron left to \"continue personal aspirations\"[58] and create his own financial consultancy firm.[59] It was later reported that Macron was planning to create an investment firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[45] Macron was shortly afterwards employed at the University of Berlin with the help of businessman, Alain Minc. Macron was awarded the position of research fellow. Macron had also sought a position at Harvard University.[60]\nMacron was offered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his hometown of Amiens. He declined the offer.[61] Manuel Valls attempted to appoint Macron as the Budget Minister but Fran\u00e7ois Hollande rejected the idea due to Macron never being elected before.[57]\nHe was appointed as the Minister of Economy and Finance in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud Montebourg.[62] He was the youngest Minister of the Economy since Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing in 1962.[63] Macron was branded by the media as the \"Anti-Montebourg\" due to being pro-EU and much more moderate, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and left wing.[64] As Minister of the Economy, Macron was at the forefront of pushing through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using the special 49.3 procedure.[65]\nMacron increased the French share in the company Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the Florange law which grants double voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of shareholders vote to overturn it.[66] This gave the French state a minority share in the company though Macron later stated that the government will limit its powers within Renault.[67]\nMacron was widely criticised for being unable to prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Is\u00e8re.[68]\nIn August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an independent.[69]\nThe \"Macron Law\" was Macron's signature law package that was eventually pushed through parliament using the 49.3 procedure.[65]\nAfter the \"Law on Growth and Purchasing Power\" brought on by Arnaud Montebourg with the aim to \"restore 6 billion euros of purchasing power\" to the French public.[70] Macron presented the Macron Law to a council of ministers. The law intended to rejuvenate the French economy by fixing regulations based around Sunday work, transport and driving licenses, public sector jobs and the transport market.[71] Manuel Valls, under the fear that the law would not find a majority in the National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3 procedure.[72] The law was adopted on 10 April 2015.[73]\nThe OECD estimated that the Macron Law would generate a \"0.3% increase in GDP over five-years and a 0.4% increase over 10-years\"[74]  Ludovic Subran, the chief economist at credit insurance company, Euler Hermes, estimated that Macron Law would give France a GDP increase of 0.5%.[75]\nMacron first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV programme \"Des Paroles Et Des Actes\" in March 2015.[76] Before forming his political party En marche, Macron had hosted a series of events with him speaking in public, his first one in March 2015 in Val-de-Marne.[77] Macron threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government over the proposed reform on removing dual-nationality from terrorists.[78][79] He also took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the advancement of digital technology.[80]\nTensions around the question of Macron's loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande himself increased when Hollande and Valls turned down a proposal for a law put forward by Macron. The law, titled \"Macron 2\" was going to be much bigger than the original Macron law with a larger aim of making the French economy competitive.[81][82] Macron was given the chance to insert his opinion into the El Khomri law and put specific parts of \"Macron 2\" into the law though El Khomri could overturn these with help of other ministers.\nAmid tensions and deterioration of relations with the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[83] A liberal,[84] progressive[85][86] political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first established,[87] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was raised.[88][89] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[90] though the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En marche including Manuel Valls,[91] Michel Sapin,[92] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[93]\nIn June 2016, support for Macron and his movement, En marche, began to grow in the media with L'Express, Les Echos, Le 1 and L'Opinion beginning to voice public support for Macron.[94] Following several controversies surrounding trade unionists and their protests, major newspapers began to run stories about Macron and En marche on their front page with mainly positive press.[95]  This was criticised hugely by the far-left in France and the far-right with the term \"Macronite\" being coined to describe the pro-Macron influence within the press.[96][97][98] The term has been expanded among the left-wing to also criticise the centrist leanings of most newspapers and their influence among left wing voter bases.[99][100][101]\nMacron was invited to attend a festival in Orl\u00e9ans by mayor Olivier Carr\u00e9 in May 2016, the festival is organised every year to celebrate Orl\u00e9ans' liberation by Joan of Arc.[102] France Info and LCI reported that Macron had attached the Republican values of the Fifth Republic to Joan of Arc and then in a speech, he compared himself to Joan of Arc.[103][104] Macron later went Puy du Fou and declared he was \"not a socialist\" in a speech amid rumours he was going to leave the current government.[105]\nOn 30 August 2016, Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential election,[106][107] to devote himself to his En marche movement.[108][109] There had been rising tensions and several reports that he wanted to leave the Valls government since early 2015.[110] Macron initially planned to leave after the cancellation of his \"Macron 2\" law[82] but after a meeting with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he decided to stay and an announcement was planned to declare that Macron was committed to the government[111] (though the announcement was pushed back due to the 2016 Nice Attack and 2016 Normandy church attack[112][113]). Michel Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement.[114] Speaking on Macron's resignation, Hollande said he had been \"betrayed\".[115] According to an IFOP poll, 84% of French agreed with Macron's decision to resign.[116]\nMacron first showed intention to run with the formation of En marche but following his resignation from the government, he was able to spend more time dedicating himself to his movement. He first announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016[117] and after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began to find patterns in Macron's fundraising and typical presidential campaign fundraising tactics.[118]\nOn 16 November 2016, Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of speculation. In his announcement speech, Macron called for a \"democratic revolution\" and promised to \"unblock France\".[119] Macron had wished that Hollande would join the race several months beforehand, saying that Hollande was the legitimate candidate for the Socialist Party.[120][121] A book was published on 24 November 2016 by Macron to support his campaign titled \"R\u00e9volution\", the book sold nearly 200,000 copies during its printing run and was one of the best selling books in France during 2016.[122][123][124]\nShortly after announcing his run, Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the Socialist Party presidential primary though Macron ultimately refused.[125][126] Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis began to threaten to exclude members who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor G\u00e9rard Collomb's declaration of support for Macron.[127]\nMacron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci, announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in donations without public funding (as En marche was not a registered political party).[128][129] This was three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Jupp\u00e9.[130] Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Beno\u00eet Hamon who requested Macron reveal a list of his donors accusing him of conflicts of interest due to Macron's past at Rothschilds.[131] Macron replied to this, calling Hamon's behavior \"demagogic.\"[132] It was later reported by journalists Marion L'Hour and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Says that Macron had spent \u20ac120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various personalities within the media and in French popular culture while he was minister.[133][134][135] Macron was then accused by deputies, Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier of using this money to further the representation of En Marche in French political life.[136][137] Michel Sapin, his successor and Minister of Economy saw nothing illegal about Macron's actions saying that Macron had the right to spend the funds.[138] Macron said in response to these allegations that it was \"defamatory\" and that none of the ministerial budget had been spent on his party.[134]\nMacron's campaign enjoyed considerable coverage from the media.[139][140][141][142][143] Mediapart reported that Macron had over fifty magazine covers dedicated purely to him compared to Melenchon's \"handful\" despite similar followings online and both having large momentum during the campaign.[144] Macron has been consistently labelled by the far-left and far-right as the \"media candidate\" and has been viewed as such in opinion polls.[145][146][147] He is friends with the owners of Le Monde[148] and Claude Perdiel the former owner of Nouvel Observateur.[149] Many observers have compared Macron's campaign to a product being sold[150] due to Maurice L\u00e9vy, a former CEO using marketing tactics to try to advance Macron's presidential ambitions.[151][152] The magazine Marianne has reported that BFMTV, whose owner is Patrick Drahi, has broadcast more coverage of Macron than all four main candidates combined,[153] Marianne has said this may be due to Macron's campaign having links with Drahi through a former colleague of Drahi, Bernard Mourad.[154][155]\nAfter a range of comparisons to centrist, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, Bayrou announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead form an electoral alliance with Macron which went into effect on 22 February 2017, and has since lasted with En marche and the Democratic Movement becoming allies in the National Assembly.[156][157] Following this, Macron's poll ratings began to rise and after several legal issues surrounding Fran\u00e7ois Fillon become publicized, Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front runner after polls shown him beating National Front candidate Marine Le Pen in the second round.[158][159]\nMacron attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his campaign; despite declaring in November, he had still not released a complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and concern among allies and supporters.[160] He eventually laid out his 150-page formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon press conference that day.[161]\nMacron accumulated a wide array of supporters, securing endorsements from Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy of the primary of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En marche, as well as numerous others \u2013 many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[162] The Grand Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[163]\nOn 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the presidential election, with 24% of the overall vote and more than 8 million votes all together. He progressed to the second round with Marine Le Pen. Former candidates Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon voiced their support for Macron.[164]\nMacron qualified for the run-off against National Front candidate Marine Le Pen on 23 April 2017, after coming first place in the vote count. Following the announcement of his qualification, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon expressed support for Macron.[164] President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande also endorsed Macron.[165] Many foreign politicians voiced support for Macron in his bid against right-wing populist candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[166] and former US President Barack Obama.[167]\nA debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The debate lasted for 2 hours and Macron was considered the winner due to opinion polls.[168]\nIn March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind \"high level attacks\" on Macron, and said that its state media are \"the first source of false information\". He said: \"We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our candidate\u00a0...\".[169]\nTwo days before the French Presidential Election on 7 May, it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were then spread onto the imageboard 4chan which led to the hashtag \"#macronleaks\" trending on Twitter.[170][171] In a statement on the same evening, Macron's political movement, En marche, said: \"The En marche movement has been the victim of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information\".[172] Macron's campaign had been presented a report before in March 2017 by the Japanese cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En marche had been the target of phishing attacks.[173] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks were Russian hacking group Fancy Bear who were also accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee on 22 July 2016.[173] These same emails were verified and released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[174] This was following Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[175]\nOn 7 May 2017, Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote compared to Marine Le Pen's 33.9%. The election had record absention at 25.4% and 8% of ballots being blank or spoilt.[176] Macron resigned from his role as president of En marche[177] and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[178]\nMacron qualified for the runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second round of the presidential election on 7 May by a landslide according to preliminary results,[179] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, concede.[180] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[181][182][183] He is also the first president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.\nMacron formally became president on 14 May.[184] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as his chief of staff[185] and Isma\u00ebl Emelien as his special advisor for strategy, communication and speeches.[186] On 15 May, he appointed \u00c9douard Philippe of the Republicans as Prime Minister.[187][188] On the same day, he made his first official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France\u2013Germany relations to the European Union.[189] They agreed to draw up a \"common road map\" for Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the European Union.[190]\nIn the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La R\u00e9publique en marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[191] After The Republicans emerged as the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner stated the elections were a \"failure\" for his party.[192]\nIn his first few months as president, Macron pressed for enactment of package of reforms on public ethics, labor laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.\nIn response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning elected representatives from hiring family members.[193] Meanwhile, the second part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after Senate objections.[194]\nMacron's plan to give his wife an official role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from it being undemocratic to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[195] Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan.[196] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping the constituency funds.[197]\nMacron aims to shift union\u2013management relations away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and Scandinavia.[198][199] He has also pledged to act against companies employing cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French workers, what he has termed as \"social dumping\". Under the EU rules, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at the salary level in eastern European countries which has led to dispute between the EU states.[200]\nThe French government announced the proposed changes to France's labour rules (\"Code du Travail\"), being among the first steps taken by Macron and his government to galvanise the French economy.[201] Macron's reform efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[202] The largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant CGT is more hostile to reforms.[198][199] Macron's labour minister, Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, is overseeing the effort.[203]\nThe National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal, allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions and employers' groups.[204] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[205] Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the biggest since 2001.[206]\nOn 23 June 2018, President Macron said: \"The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015\", \"A country like Italy has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis\".[207] In November 2019, Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees reaching France, while stating to \"take back control\u201d of the immigration policy.[208]\nPierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies, stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[209] De Villiers cited the military budget cut of \u20ac850 million as the main reason he was stepping down. Le Monde later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary group, \"I will not let myself be fucked like this.\"[210] Macron named Fran\u00e7ois Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[211]\nMacron's government presented its first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[212] The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[213] Before it was replaced, the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global worth exceeded \u20ac1.3m.[214]\nIn February 2017, Macron announced a plan to offer voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil service.[215] In December 2019, Macron informed that he would scrap 20th century Byzantine pension system and introduce a single nations pension system managed by the state.[216] In January 2019, after weeks of public transport shutdown and  vandalization across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron compromised the plan by revising the retirement age.[217]\nIn July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron. The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass the bill 415\u2013127, with 19 abstentions. Interior Minister G\u00e9rard Collomb described France as being \"still in a state of war\" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second reading by a 244\u201322 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13 terror plots had been foiled since 2017 began. The law replaced the state of emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[218]\nThe bill was criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by Le Figaro showed 57% of the respondents approved it even though 62% thought it would encroach on personal freedoms.[219]\nThe law gives authorities expanded power to search homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[220] and search areas around train stations as well as international ports and airports. It was passed after modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive measures will be reviewed annually and are scheduled to lapse by the end of 2020.[221] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October. He announced that, starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of emergency.[222]\nSpeaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais Jungle, Macron said he would not allow another refugee camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration and asylum.[223] He announced plans to speed up asylum applications and deportations but give refugees better housing.[224]\nVisiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy when he rejected nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official language[225] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[226]\nMacron also proposed a plan to \"reorganise\" the Islamic religion in France saying: \"We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to explain it, which is extremely important \u2013 my goal is to rediscover what lies at the heart of la\u00efcit\u00e9, the possibility of being able to believe as not to believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having free consciousness.\" He declined to reveal further information about the plan.[227]\nMacron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake between the two of them being characterized as a \"power-struggle\".[228][229]\nOn 29 May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik accusing the news agencies of being \"organs of influence and propaganda, of lying propaganda\".[230][231] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if chemical weapons are used.[232] In response to the chemical attack in Douma, Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United Kingdom.[233][234]\nIn his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August, President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized Venezuela's government as a \"dictatorship\". He added that he would announce his new initiatives on the future of European Union after the German elections in September.[235]\nAccording to the IFOP poll for Le Journal du Dimanche, Macron started his five-year term with a 62 per cent approval rating.[236][237] This was higher than Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's popularity at the start of his first term (61 per cent) but lower than Sarkozy's (65 per cent).[238]\nAn IFOP poll on 24 June 2017 said that 64 percent of French people were pleased with Macron's performance.[239] In the IFOP poll on 23 July 2017, Macron suffered a 10 percent point drop in popularity, the largest for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995.[240] 54 per cent of French people approved of Macron's performance[241] a 24 percentage point drop in three months.[242] The main contributors to this drop in popularity are his recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre De Villiers,[243] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore &amp; Shipbuilding,[244] and the reduction in housing benefit.[245] In August 2017, IFOP polls stated that 40 per cent approved and 57 per cent disapproved of his performance.[246]\nBy the end of September 2017, seven out of ten respondents said that they believe Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign promises,[247][248] though a majority felt that the policies the government was putting forward were \"unfair.\"[249]\nMacron's popularity fell sharply in 2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November. Dissatisfaction with his presidency has been expressed by protestors in the yellow vests movement.[250][251]\nOn 18 July 2018, Le Monde revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15 days before only being internally demoted. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e failed to refer the case to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required under the code of criminal procedure.[252]\nOverall, Macron is largely seen as a centrist.[253][254][255][256][257][258] Some observers describe him as a social liberal[259][260][84][261][262] and others call him a social democrat.[263][264][265] During his time in the French Socialist Party, he supported the party's centrist wing,[266] whose political stance has been associated with \"third way\" policies advanced by Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and whose leading spokesman has been former prime minister Manuel Valls.[267][268][269][270]\nIn the past, Macron has called himself a socialist,[271] but since August 2015, he has labelled himself as a centrist liberal. He has refused observations by critics that he is an \"ultra-liberal\" economically.[272][273][274][275] During a visit to Vendee in August 2016, he said he was not a socialist and that he just served in a \"left wing government.\"[276] He has called himself both left wing and liberal in his book R\u00e9volution.[277] Macron has since been labeled a libertarian with a socially liberal viewpoint.[278]\nMacron created the centrist political party En Marche with the attempt to create a party that can cross partisan lines.[279] Speaking on why he formed En marche, he said there is a real divide in France between \"conservatives and progressives\"[280] His political platform during the 2017 French Presidential Election contained stances from both the right wing and the left wing[281] which led to him being positioned as a \"radical centrist\" by Le Figaro.[282] Macron has rejected the term \"centrist\"[283] though political scientist Luc Rouban has compared his platform to former centrist president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, who is the only other French president to have been elected on a centrist platform.[284]\nMacron has been compared to former president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing due to their ability to win a presidential election on a centrist platform and for their similar governing styles. Both were inspectors of finance, were given responsibilities based around tax and revenue, both were very ambitious about running for the position of president, showing their keenness early in their careers and both were seen as figures of renewal in French political life.[285][286][287][288][289][290] d'Estaing even said himself in 2016 that he was \"a little like Macron.\"[291] Observers have noted that while they are alike ideologically, d'Estaing had ministerial experience and time in Parliament to show for his political life while Macron had never been elected before.[292]\nMacron has advocated in favour of the free market and reducing the public-finances deficit.[293] He first publicly used the term \"liberal\" to describe himself in a 2015 interview with Le Monde. He added that he is \"neither right nor left\" and that he advocates \"a collective solidarity\".[294][295] During a visit to the Puy du Fou in Vend\u00e9e with Philippe de Villiers in August 2016, he stated, \"Honesty compels me to say that I am not a socialist.\"[296] He explained that he was part of the \"left government\" because he wanted \"to serve the public interest\" as any minister would.[297] In his book R\u00e9volution, published in November 2016, Macron presents himself as both a \"leftist\" and a \"liberal\u00a0... if by liberalism one means trust in man.\"[298]\nWith his party En marche, Macron's stated aim is to transcend the left\u2013right divide in a manner similar to Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou or Jacques Chaban-Delmas, asserting that \"the real divide in our country\u00a0... is between progressives and conservatives\". With the launch of his independent candidacy and his use of anti-establishment rhetoric, Macron has been labelled a \"populist\" by some observers, notably Manuel Valls, but Macron rejects this term.[299][300]\nMacron is a supporter of the El Khomri law. He became the most vocal proponent of the economic overhaul of the country.[301] Macron has stated that he wants to go further than the El Khomri law when reforming the Labor code.[302]\nMacron is in favor of tax cuts. During the 2017 Presidential Election, Macron proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 33.3% to 25%. Macron also wants to remove investment income from the wealth tax so that it is solely a tax on high-value property.[303] Macron also wants to exempt 18 million households from local residence tax, branding the tax as \"unfair\" during his 2017 presidential campaign.[304][305][306]\nMacron is against raising taxes on the highest earners. When asked about Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's proposal to raise income tax on the upper class to 75%, Macron compared the policy to the Cuban taxation system.[307] Macron supports stopping tax avoidance.[308]\nMacron has advocated for the end of the 35 hour work week;[309][310] however, his view has changed over time and he now seeks reforms that aim to preserve the 35 hour work week while increasing France's competitiveness.[311] He has said that he wants to return flexibility to companies without ending the 35 work week.[312] This would include companies renegotiating work hours and overtime payments with employees.\nMacron has supported cutting the amount of civil servants by 120,000.[313] Macron also supports spending cuts, saying he would cut 60 billion euros in public spending over a span of five years.[314]\nHe has supported the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union and criticized the Walloon government for trying to block it.[315] He believes that CETA should not require the endorsement of national parliaments because \"it undermines the EU\".[316] Macron supports the idea of giving the Eurozone its own common budget.[317][318][314]\nRegarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Macron stated in June 2016 that \"the conditions [to sign the treaty] are not met\", adding that \"we mustn't close the door entirely\" and \"need a strong link with the US\".[319]\nIn April 2017, Macron called for a \"rebalancing\" of Germany's trade surplus, saying that \"Germany benefits from the imbalances within the Eurozone and achieves very high trade surpluses\".[320]\nIn March 2018, Macron announced that the government would spend 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to boost innovation. The money would be used to sponsor research projects and scientific laboratories, as well as to finance startup companies within the country whose focus is AI.[321]\nMacron described France's colonization of Algeria as a \"crime against humanity\".[322][323] He also said: \"It's truly barbarous and it's part of a past that we need to confront by apologizing to those against whom we committed these acts.\"[324] Polls following his remarks reflected a decrease in his support.[322]\nMacron described the 2011 military intervention in Libya as a \"historic error\".[325]\nIn 2012, Macron was a Young Leader with the French-American Foundation.[326]\nIn January 2017, he said France needed a more \"balanced\" policy toward Syria, including talks with Bashar al-Assad.[327] In April 2017, following the chemical attack in Khan Shaykhun, Macron proposed a possible military intervention against the Assad regime, preferably under United Nations auspices.[328] He has warned if the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons during his presidency he will act unilaterally to punish it.[325]\nHe supports the continuation of President Hollande's policies on Israel, opposes the BDS movement, and has refused to state a position on recognition of the State of Palestine.[329] In May 2018, Macron condemned \"the violence of Israeli armed forces\" against Palestinians in Gaza border protests.[330]\nHe criticized the Franco-Swiss construction firm LafargeHolcim for competing to build the wall on the Mexico-United States border promised by U.S. President Donald Trump.[331]\nMacron has called for a peaceful solution during the 2017 North Korea crisis,[332] though he agreed to work with US President Trump against North Korea.[333] Macron and Trump apparently conducted a phone call on 12 August 2017 where they discussed confronting North Korea, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and enforcing new sanctions.[334]\nMacron condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He described the situation as \"genocide\" and \"ethnic purification\", and alluded to the prospect of UN-led intervention.[335]\nIn response to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, Macron said that Turkey must respect Syria's sovereignty, despite his condemnation of Bashar al-Assad.[336]\nMacron has voiced support for the Saudi Arabian-led military campaign against Yemen's Shiite rebels.[337] He also defended France's arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition.[338] Some rights groups have argued that France is violating national and international law by selling weapons to members of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.[339][340]\nIn response to the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of organ failure while in government custody, Macron praised Liu as \"a freedom fighter\". Macron also described as \"extremely fruitful and positive\" his first contacts with President Xi Jinping.[341]\nAn article in the New York Times described Emmanuel Macron as \"ardently pro-Europe\" and stated that he \"has proudly embraced an unpopular European Union.\"[342]\nMacron was described by some as Europhile[343][344] and federalist[345][346] but he describes himself as \"neither pro-European, eurosceptic nor a federalist in the classical sense\",[347] and his party as \"the only pro-European political force in France\".[348]\nIn June 2015, Macron and his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel published a platform advocating a continuation of European integration. They advocate the continuation \"of structural reforms (such as labor markets), institutional reforms (including the area of economic governance)\",[349] but also a reconciliation of 'tax and social systems (like better co-ordination or harmonization of the corporate taxes via, for example, minimum wages)\".[citation needed]\nHe also advocates the creation of a post of the EU Commissioner that would be responsible for the Eurozone and Eurozone's Parliament and a common budget.[350]\nIn addition, Macron stated: \"I'm in favor of strengthening anti-dumping measures which have to be faster and more powerful like those in the United States. We also need to establish a monitoring of foreign investments in strategic sectors at the EU level in order to protect a vital industry and to ensure our sovereignty and the European superiority.\"[294]\nMacron also stated that, if elected, he would seek to renegotiate the Treaty of Le Touquet with the United Kingdom which has caused a build-up of economic migrants in Calais. When Macron served as economy minister he had suggested the Treaty could be scrapped if the UK left the European Union.[351]\nOn 1 May 2017, Macron said the EU needs to reform or face Frexit.[352] On 26 September, he unveiled his proposals for the EU, intending to deepen the bloc politically and harmonise its rules. He argued for institutional changes, initiatives to promote EU, along with new ventures in the technology, defence and energy sectors. His proposals also included setting up a rapid reaction force working along with national armies while establishing a finance minister, budget and parliament for the Eurozone. He also called for a new tax on technology giants, an EU-wide asylum agency to deal with the refugee crisis, and changes to the Common Agricultural Policy.[353]\nFollowing the declaration of independence by Catalonia, Macron joined the EU in supporting Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy.[354] In a conversation with BBC's Andrew Marr, Macron stated that theoretically if France should choose to withdraw from the EU, they would do so through a national popular vote.[355] In November 2019, Macron blocked EU accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia, proposing changes to EU Enlargement policy. In an interview with The Economist, Macron explained that the EU was too reliant on NATO and the US, and that it should initiate \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d with Russia.[356]\nAfter the European elections in 2019, it was Macron in particular who prevented the leading candidate of the European People's Party, Manfred Weber, as president of the European Commission. Previously it was a tradition that always the top candidate of the largest party took over this post. Critics accuse Macron of having ignored by his actions the democratic decision of the voters for power-political reasons, and thus sacrificed the democratic principles of his own interests.[357]\nIn July 2015, as economy minister, Macron stated in an interview that any Greece bailout package must also ease their burden by including reductions in the country's overall debt.[358] In July 2015, while challenging the \"loaded question\" of the 2015 Greek referendum, Macron called for resisting the \"automatic ejection\" of Greece from the Eurozone and avoiding \"the Versailles Treaty of the Eurozone,\" in which case the \"No\" side would win. He believes that the Greek and European leaders co-produced the Greek government-debt crisis,[359] and that the agreement reached in summer 2015 between Greece and its creditors, notably driven by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will not help Greece in dealing with the debt, while at the same time criticizing the International Monetary Fund.[360]\nIn June 2016, he criticized the austerity policies imposed on Greece, considering them to be unsustainable and calling for the joint establishment of \"fiscal and financial solidarity mechanisms\" and a mechanism for restructuring the debt of Eurozone member states.[360] Yanis Varoufakis, minister of finance in the First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras, praised Macron, calling him \"the only French Minister in the Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's administration that seemed to understand what was at stake in the Eurozone\" and who, according to him, \"tried to play the intermediary between us [Greece] and the troika of our creditors EC, IMF, ECB even if they don't allow him to play the role\".[361]\nPresident Macron supports NATO and its role in the security of eastern European states and he also said pressure NATO partners like Poland to uphold what he called \"European values\". He said in April 2017 that \"in the three months after I'm elected, there will be a decision on Poland. You cannot have a European Union which argues over every single decimal place on the issue of budgets with each country, and which, when you have an EU member which acts like Poland or Hungary on issues linked to universities and learning, or refugees, or fundamental values, decides to do nothing.\"[362] Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in response that Macron \"violated European standards and the principles of friendship with Poland\".[363]\nDuring a press conference with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles in May 2017, he condemned the Russian state media as \"lying propaganda.\"[364] At the same month, he said that \"we all know who Le Pen\u2019s allies are. The regimes of Orb\u00e1n, Kaczy\u0144ski, Putin. These aren\u2019t the regimes with an open and free democracy. Every day they break many democratic freedoms.\"[365]\nMacron said that the European Commission needs to do more to stop the influx of low-paid temporary workers from Central and Eastern Europe into France.[366]\nUnlike many French Socialists, including former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, Macron supports the open-door policy toward migrants from the Middle East and Africa pursued by Angela Merkel in Germany[367] and promotes tolerance towards immigrants and Muslims.[342] Macron has expressed confidence in France's ability to absorb more immigrants and welcomes their arrival into Europe, asserting that the influx will have a positive economic impact.[368]\nHowever, he believes that Frontex (the European Border and Coast Guard Agency) is \"not a sufficiently ambitious program\" and has called for more investment in coast and border guards, \"because anyone who enters [Europe] at Lampedusa or elsewhere is a concern for all European countries\".[316]\nIn June 2018 the  Aquarius (NGO ship) carrying 629 migrants that were rescued near Libya was denied entry to the Sicilian port by Italy's new interior minister Matteo Salvini.[369] Italian PM Giuseppe Conte accused France of hypocrisy after Macron said Italy was acting \"irresponsibly\" by refusing entry to migrants and suggested it had violated international maritime law.[370] Italy's deputy PM Luigi Di Maio said: \"I am happy the French have discovered responsibility\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they should open their ports and we will send a few people to France.\"[371]\nMacron believes that the proposed reform bill on deprivation of citizenship for French-born and naturalized citizens convicted on terrorism charges was not a \"concrete solution\" and believes that \"the endless prolongation of the state of emergency raises legitimate questions\". He advocates an increase in state funding of intelligence agencies.[372]\nMacron calls for a restoration of community policing and considers that \"the management of some major risks must be delegated to the associations' or the private sector\".[373]\nHe considers that his proposal to provide each young adult a \"Culture Pass\" of \u20ac500 may encourage young people to discover the culture of France and deter terrorism.[374]\nMacron has endorsed proposals to make it mandatory for Internet companies to allow the government to access encrypted communications from customers.[375]\nMacron expressed deep regret at US President Trump's decision to take back U.S. armed forces from Syria.[376]\nIn October 2019, Macron warned that Turkey would be responsible for helping Islamic State to re-establish a Caliphate in Syria as he called on Turkey to stop its military offensive against Kurdish forces the north of Syria.[377]\nAhead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Macron called for acceleration of the ecological transition and advocated a \"balance between ecological imperatives and economic requirements\", an objective that the French government seeks to achieve by fighting on \"five fronts\": \"innovation\", \"simplification\", \"strengthening of our energy efficiency and [...] reduction of fossil fuel usage\",  \"energy competitiveness\" and \"action in Europe and worldwide\".[378]\nDuring the summer of 2016, he defended the use of diesel fuel, which he believes there should not be a \"hunt\" for since it \"remains at the heart of the French industrial policy\". Macron expressed this opinion in the aftermath of the Volkswagen emissions scandal. He was then part of a Socialist-backed government; prominent members from that party, including Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, criticized that position.[379][380][381] In addition, Macron is in favor of using nuclear energy which he considers \"a French choice and a choice for the future\".[382] Nevertheless, in the multi-year energy program (programmation pluriannuelle de l'\u00e9nergie, PPE) Macron committed to reduce the use of nuclear energy in France by 2035.[383]\nIn 2016, Macron proposed that France \"secures its supplies in the most strategic materials using three levers: the circular economy and the recovery of materials contained in the end of life of the products [...]; the diversification of supplies to overcome geopolitical risks [...] and to bring more competitiveness; the creation of new reasonably-sized mines in France, while following the best social and environmental standards\".[384]\nAlthough he is sceptical about the construction of the A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest, Macron stated he believed the construction should start since the people backed the project in the 2016 local referendum. However, after Macron's inauguration, Prime Minister Philippe said that the plans for construction would be abandoned.[385] He criticised Donald Trump for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord on 2 June 2017, and called for scientists to come to France in order to work together on climate change.[386]\nIn 2018, Macron announced that France would commit 700 million euros to the International Solar Alliance, a treaty-based alliance to expand solar power infrastructure.[387] In the same year, Macron announced that France would phase out coal power, with the target of shutting down all coal-fired power stations (which make up about 1% of French energy generation) by 2021.[388]\nIn 2018, he pursued a petrol tax, albeit, the tax stems from an earlier policy under his predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.[389] A burgeoning grassroots movement, the Gilets jaunes protests developed throughout France in November and December, extending even to the overseas territory of R\u00e9union. On 4 December, Prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe announced that the tax increase would be pushed back six months.[390] The following day however, Macron scrapped the fuel tax increase altogether.[391]\nOn January 13, 2019, he penned a 2,300-word letter[392] addressing the nation in response to 9 consecutive weeks of protests by the Gilets Jaunes movement, calling for 3 months of national debate to address grievances.[393]\nMacron called the 2019 Brazil wildfires an \"international crisis\" as the Amazon rainforest produces \"20% of the world's oxygen.\"[394] Macron stated he will refuse to ratify the EU\u2013Mercosur Free Trade Agreement unless Brazil commits to protecting the environment.[395]\nMacron supports the principle of secularism (la\u00efcit\u00e9). He also said that \"we have a duty to let everybody practice their religion with dignity\".[396] In July 2016, at the first meeting of En marche, Macron expressed opposition to banning Muslim headscarves in universities, stating, \"Personally, I do not believe we should be inventing new texts, new laws, new standards, in order to hunt down veils at universities and go after people who wear religious symbols during field trips.\"[397]\nIn an interview with the French news magazine Marianne, Macron asserted that \"secularism is not designed to promote a republican religion\", and responded to comments by Manuel Valls and Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement regarding the practice of Islam in French society by condemning the notion that citizens should be \"discreet\" in their religious practice, stating that \"historical precedents when we asked for discretion in matters of religion did not bring honor to the Republic.\"[398]\nIn the same interview, Macron said of French Muslims, \"I ask one thing: absolutely respect the rules while in public. Religious relationships are about transcendence, and I am not asking people to be moderate \u2013 that's not what I'm arguing. My own deep conviction is that a practising Catholic may believe that the laws of his religion go far beyond the laws of the Republic. I simply believe that when one enters the public realm, the laws of the Republic must prevail over religious law.\"  He also condemned \"religious schools that teach hatred towards the Republic, with instruction mainly in Arabic or, in other instances, which teach the Torah more than basic fundamentals.\"[398]  This statement triggered an intense negative reaction from the Fonds Social Juif Unifi\u00e9 (FSJU), an organization that runs Jewish religious schools in France.[399]\nRegarding support for Macron from religious groups, Jean-Dominique Durand\u2014an expert on the history of contemporary Christianity and a deputy mayor of Lyon\u2014said to The Washington Post: \"What we have now is silence from the bishops. Protestants, Muslims, Jews have all mobilized for Macron. Not the Catholics, not in any clear way.\"\nMacron supports stopping what he calls the \"compartmentalisation of healthcare\" by allowing private practitioners into public hospitals.[400] Macron also supports investing money in medical science to develop new technology and find better ways to treat patients.[401]\nMacron advocates for national health insurance covering optics, hearing and dentalcare.[402] According to Les Echos, extending national health insurance coverage to optics, hearing and dentalcare would cost \u20ac4.4 billion a year.[403]\nMacron supports giving more autonomy to schools and universities.[404][405] Macron wants to create a programme that forces schools to pay experienced teachers higher salaries and give them more educational freedom.[404]\nMacron wants to combat the issue of income inequality in schools by attempting to improve working-class schools and providing incentives to more well-off children as a way to persuade them into attending working-class schools.[404]\nMacron wants to make vocational education a priority. He has referred to Germany's system as one that his government would follow when putting forward measures relating to vocational education.[406]\nIn July 2017, while at a ceremony at the site of the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver where 13,000 Jews had been rounded up for deportation to death camps in July 1942, Macron denounced his country's role in the Holocaust and the historical revisionism that denied France's responsibility for the 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup and the eventual deportation of 76,000 Jews. Earlier that year, Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front, had stated in speeches that the government during WWII \"was not France\".[407][408]\n\"It was indeed France that organised this [roundup]\", Macron said, French police collaborating with the Nazis. \"Not a single German took part,\" he added. Previous president Jacques Chirac had already stated that the Government during the War represented the French State.[409] Macron further stated: \"It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it's convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie.\"[410][411]\nMacron made a subtle reference to Chirac's 1995 apology when he added, \"I say it again here. It was indeed France that organized the roundup, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.\"[412][413]\nIn his speech condemning the historical collaboration of France with the Nazis, Macron also termed anti-Zionism as a new form of antisemitism. While addressing Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, Macron stated that \"we will never surrender to the messages of hate; we will not surrender to anti-Zionism because it is a reinvention of anti-Semitism.\"[414] He also drew parallels between antisemitism in the past and present. He stated, \"You only need to stop for a moment,\" adding, \"to see, behind the new fa\u00e7ade, the racism of old, the entrenched vein of anti-Semitism.\"[415]\nIn November 2018 he referred to nationalism as the \"exact opposite\" of patriotism, and a betrayal of it, characterizing nationalism as \"who cares about others\".[416] This prompted criticism that his definition was wrong.[417][418] Macron is accused by members of the Yellow vests of being an \"ultra-liberal president for the rich\".[419]\nAs President of France, Macron also serves ex officio as one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. His chief of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity.\nMacron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[420] 24 years his senior,[421] who was a teacher in his high school, La Providence High School in Amiens.[422][423] They met during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student and she was a 39-year-old teacher, but they only became a couple once he was 18.[424][425] His parents initially attempted to separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][425] However, the couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[425] She has three children from a previous marriage, but Macron has no children of his own.[426] Trogneux's role in Macron's 2017 presidential campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that Trogneux assisted Macron with developing skills such as public speaking.[427]\nHis best man was Henry Hermand (1924\u20132016), a businessman who loaned \u20ac550,000 to Macron for the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances.

                "text": "no title\n\nMichael Richard Pence (born June 7, 1959) is an American politician and lawyer serving as the 48th vice president of the United States. He previously was the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017 and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. He is the younger brother of U.S. Representative Greg Pence. Born and raised in Columbus, Indiana, Pence graduated from Hanover College and earned a law degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law before entering private practice. After losing two bids for a U.S. congressional seat in 1988 and 1990, he became a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. Pence was elected to the United States Congress in 2000 and represented Indiana's 2nd congressional district and Indiana's 6th congressional district in the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. He served as the chairman of the House Republican Conference from 2009 to 2011.[2] Pence described himself as a \"principled conservative\" and supporter of the Tea Party movement,[3] stating that he was \"a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[4] Pence successfully sought the Republican nomination for the 2012 Indiana gubernatorial election when term-limited Mitch Daniels retired. He defeated former speaker John R. Gregg in the closest gubernatorial election in 50 years.[5][6] Upon becoming governor in January 2013, Pence initiated the largest tax cut in Indiana's history and pushed for more funding for education initiatives. Pence signed bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetus's race, gender, or disability.[7] After Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), he encountered fierce resistance from moderate members of his party, the business community, and LGBT advocates. The backlash against the RFRA led Pence to amend the bill to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and other criteria. Pence was inaugurated as vice president of the United States on January 20, 2017. He had withdrawn his gubernatorial reelection campaign in July to become the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who went on to win the presidential election on November 8, 2016. Michael Richard Pence was born June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Nancy Jane (n\u00e9e Cawley) and Edward Joseph Pence Jr.,[8][9] who ran a group of gas stations.[10][11] His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph.[12] His maternal family were Irish Catholic Democrats.[13] Pence was named after his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from County Sligo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island, following an aunt and his brother James, and became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois.[14][15][16][17] His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare.[18][19] Pence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a BA degree in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a JD degree from the Indiana University's Robert H. McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis in 1986.[20] While at Hanover, Pence joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he became the chapter president.[21] After graduating from Hanover, Pence was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983.[22] In his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat. He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election,[1][16] and has said he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[1] While in college, Pence became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the great disappointment of his mother.[1][16] His political views also started shifting to the right during this time in his life, something which Pence attributes to the \"common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan\" with which he began to identify.[1][23] After graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice.[24] He ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in 1988 and in 1990. In 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network, a position he held until 1993.[25][26][27] Shortly after his first congressional campaign in 1988, radio station WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana, hired Pence to host a weekly half-hour radio show, Washington Update with Mike Pence.[28] In 1992, Pence began hosting a daily talk show on WRCR, The Mike Pence Show, in addition to a Saturday show on WNDE in Indianapolis.[25][28][29][30] Pence called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as bombastic as Limbaugh.[31][32] Beginning on April 11, 1994, Network Indiana syndicated The Mike Pence Show statewide.[33] With a 9:00\u00a0a.m. to noon (ET) time slot, the program reached as many as 18 radio stations in Indiana, including WIBC in Indianapolis.[25] Pence ended his radio show in September 1999 to focus on his 2000 campaign for Congress, which he eventually won.[34] From 1995 to 1999, Pence hosted a weekend public affairs TV show also titled The Mike Pence Show on Indianapolis TV station WNDY.[28][35] In 1988, Pence ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost.[36] He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful.[36] During the race, Pence used \"political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife.\"[37] While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign.[37] During the 1990 campaign, Pence ran a television advertisement in which an actor, dressed in a robe and headdress and speaking in a thick Middle Eastern accent, thanked his opponent, Sharp, for doing nothing to wean the United States off imported oil as chairman of a House subcommittee on energy and power.[37][38] In response to criticism, Pence's campaign responded that the ad was not about Arabs; rather, it concerned Sharp's lack of leadership.[37][38] In 1991, Pence wrote an essay, \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner\", published in the Indiana Policy Review, in which he apologized for running negative ads against Sharp.[31][37][39] Mike Pence rejuvenated his political career by running for the U.S. House of Representatives again in 2000, this time winning the seat in Indiana's 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent David M. McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana. The district (renumbered as Indiana's 6th congressional district beginning in 2002) comprises all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana. As a congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\"[4] While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus.[40] In his first year in office, Pence opposed President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act in 2001,[41] as well as President Bush's Medicare prescription drug expansion the following year.[42] Pence was re-elected four more times by comfortable margins. In the 2006, 2008, and 2010 House elections, he defeated Democrat Barry Welsh.[43][44][45] Pence began to climb the party leadership structure and from 2005 to 2007 was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans.[46] In November 2006, Pence announced his candidacy for leader of the Republican Party (minority leader) in the United States House of Representatives.[47] Pence's release announcing his run for minority leader focused on a \"return to the values\" of the Newt Gingrich-headed 1994 Republican Revolution.[47] However, he lost the bid to Representative John Boehner of Ohio by a vote of 168 for Boehner, 27 for Pence, and one for Representative Joe Barton of Texas.[48] In January 2009, Pence was elected as the Republican Conference chairman, the third-highest-ranking Republican leadership position. He ran unopposed and was elected unanimously. He was the first representative from Indiana to hold a House leadership position since 1981.[2] During Pence's twelve years in the House, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions; none became law.[49] His committee assignments in the House were the following: In 2008, Esquire magazine listed Pence as one of the ten best members of Congress, writing that Pence's \"unalloyed traditional conservatism has repeatedly pitted him against his party elders.\"[56] Pence was mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for president in 2008[57] and 2012.[58] In September 2010, he was the top choice for president in a straw poll conducted by the Values Voter Summit.[59][60] That same year he was encouraged to run against incumbent Democratic senator Evan Bayh,[61][62][63] but opted not to enter the race,[64] even after Bayh unexpectedly announced that he would retire.[65] In May 2011, Mike Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012.[66] Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. He ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels.[67][68] Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote and less than 3% ahead of Democrat John R. Gregg, and trailed by Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham.[69] Pence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.[70] Pence \"inherited a $2\u00a0billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state\u00a0... added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections.\"[71] The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2\u00a0billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14\u00a0billion annual state budget include $24\u00a0million cut from colleges and universities; $27\u00a0million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA);[72] and $12\u00a0million cut from the Department of Correction.[73] During Pence's term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average.[74] Indiana's job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend.[75] In 2014, Indiana's economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector.[76] Carrier Corp. and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves[77] and Pence expressed \"deep disappointment\".[78][79] Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received.[79][80] The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24\u00a0million in incentives to 10 companies who sent jobs abroad. $8.7\u00a0million had been paid out by August 2016.[77] In 2013, Pence signed a law blocking local governments in Indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law. In 2015, Pence also repealed an Indiana law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage.[81][82][83][84] Indiana enacted right-to-work legislation under Pence's predecessor, Republican governor Mitch Daniels. Under Pence, the state successfully defended this legislation against a labor challenge.[82] In 2013, Pence also announced the formation of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, a life sciences research facility supported with $25\u00a0million in startup funds from the state.[85] Pence made tax reform, namely a 10 percent income-tax rate cut, a priority for 2013.[86][87] While he did not get the 10 percent cut he advocated, Pence did accomplish his goal of cutting state taxes.[86] Legislators cut the income tax by five percent and also killed the inheritance tax.[86] Speaker of the House Brian Bosma said the legislative package was the \"largest tax cut in our state's history, about $1.1\u00a0billion dollars.\"[88] By signing Senate Bill 1, the state corporate income tax would be dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by 2021, which would be the second-lowest corporate income tax in the nation.[89] The law also permitted Indiana counties to eliminate the business personal property tax on new equipment and let them exempt small businesses with less than $20,000 worth of equipment from paying personal property taxes.[89] On June 12, 2013, the Indiana Legislature overrode Pence's veto of a bill to retroactively authorize a local tax. Lawmakers overrode Pence's veto in a 68\u201323 vote in the House and a 34\u201312 one in the Senate.[90] Republican legislators overwhelmingly voted against Pence, while most Democrats supported his veto.[91] The Jackson\u2013Pulaski tax fix, one of three bills vetoed by Pence during the session, addressed a 15-year-old county income tax which had been imposed to fund the construction of jail facilities with the stipulation that the tax be lowered by one percent after the first several years. The reduction was not implemented and thus county residents paid an additional one percent tax that they were legally not required to pay. The bill, which was passed by a huge majority of legislators and subsequently vetoed by Pence, allowed money to be kept and not returned to the taxpayers as would have otherwise been necessary.[91][92] As governor, Pence pressed for a balanced budget amendment to the state's constitution. He initially proposed the initiative in his State of the State address in January 2015. The legislation passed the state Senate.[93] Indiana has had AAA credit ratings with the three major credit-rating agencies since 2010, before Pence took office; these ratings were maintained throughout Pence's tenure.[94] In 2014, Pence supported the Indiana Gateway project,[95] a $71.4\u00a0million passenger and freight rail improvement initiative paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus package), which Pence had voted against while a congressman.[96] In October 2015, Pence \"announced plans to pay off a $250\u00a0million federal loan\" to cover unemployment insurance payments which had spiked during the recession.[71] In March 2016, Pence signed legislation to fund a $230\u00a0million two-year road-funding package.[71] During his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools.[97][98] In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10\u00a0million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan.[97][98] Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool.\"[98] Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80\u00a0million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding,[97] arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion.\"[99] After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds.[97][100] In 2015, Pence secured significant increases in charter-school funding from the legislation, although he did not get everything he had proposed.[98] Legislation signed into law by Pence in 2013 greatly increased the number of students in Indiana who qualify for school vouchers, making it one of the largest voucher programs in the United States.[101][102][103][104] The annual cost of the program is estimated to be $53\u00a0million for the 2015\u201316 school year.[103][104] Pence opposed the Common Core State Standards Initiative, calling for the repeal of the standards in his 2014 State of the State address. The Indiana General Assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so.[97][98] Despite successful advocacy for more funding for pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, Pence has frequently clashed with teachers unions and supporters of public schooling.[97][98] In one of his first acts as governor, Pence removed control of the Educational Employment Relations Board, which was in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards, from Glenda Ritz, a Democrat who was the Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction (a separately elected position in the state).[105] Pence created a new \"Center for Education and Career Innovation\" (CECI) to coordinate efforts between schools and the private sector; Ritz opposed the Center, viewing it as a \"power grab\" and encroachment on her own duties. Pence eventually disestablished the Center in order to help defuse the conflict.[97][98] In May 2015, Pence signed a bill stripping Ritz of much of her authority over standardized testing and other education issues, and reconstituting the State Board of Education dominated by Pence appointees.[106] The bill also allowed the board to appoint a chairman other than the Superintendent of Public Instruction starting in 2017, and added the State Board of Education (controlled by Pence) as a \"state educational authority\" along with the Department of Education (controlled by Ritz) for purposes of accessing sensitive student data.[106] Pence and Ritz also clashed over non-binding federal guidelines that advised Indiana public schools must treat transgender students in a way that corresponds to their gender identity, even if their education files indicate a different gender.[107] During Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly \"repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts.\"[108] Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy,\" and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.\"[108][109] In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan.[108][110] Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan.[108] In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.[111] In 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property.[112] In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry. Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue.[113] In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns.[114][115] The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana Attorney General Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government.\"[115] In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in Indiana.[116] In 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site. Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency;[117] his successor Governor Eric Holcomb has issued Executive Order 17-13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago.[118][119] The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997.[120] Beginning in December 2014, there was an HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana.[121] In 2011, Planned Parenthood ran five rural clinics in Indiana. They tested for HIV and offered prevention, intervention and counseling for better health. The one in Scott County performed no abortions.[122] The Republican-controlled legislature and Pence defunded Planned Parenthood.[123] Scott County has been without an HIV testing center since 2013.[122] Pence had long been a vocal opponent of needle exchange programs, which allow drug users to trade in used syringes for sterile ones in order to stop the spread of diseases, despite evidence that such programs prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C, and do not increase drug abuse.[121] In March 2015, after the outbreak began, Pence allowed at least five counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges.[121] Critics say Pence's compromise has been ineffective because counties had no way to pay for needle exchanges themselves. Indiana State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams defended Pence, saying that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities.[124] In 2015, Pence and the Obama administration agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.[125][126] As part of the expansion, called the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, Pence negotiated modifications to the program for Indiana that included co-payments by participants. The co-payments are linked to healthy behaviors on the part of the participants so that, for example, a participant who quit smoking would receive a lower co-payment. Participants can lose benefits for failing to make the payments.[127] The required contribution would be about 2% of income. Critics say those who already struggle to buy food and housing will have even more difficulty paying their 2%. One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. A service provider said the program \"wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape.\"[128] In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. National Public Radio/Side Effects Public Media said the application used \"misleading and inaccurate information.\"[129] On March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana \"religious objections\" bill (Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA), into law.[130] The law's signing was met with criticism by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons.[131][132][133][134] Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with Salesforce.com saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state.[135][136] Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40\u00a0million expansion of their Indianapolis based headquarters over concerns with the law. The expansion would have moved 1000 jobs into the state.[137] Thousands protested against the policy.[131] Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the \"wrong signal\" about the state.[138] Pence defended the law, saying it was not about discrimination. In an appearance on the ABC News program This Week with George Stephanopoulos[139] he said, \"We are not going to change this law,\" while refusing to answer whether examples of discrimination against LGBT people given by Eric Miller of anti-LGBT group Advance America would be legal under the law.[140] Pence denied the law permitted discrimination and wrote in a March 31, 2015, Wall Street Journal op-ed, \"If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn't eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it.\"[141] In the wake of the backlash against the RFRA, on April 2, 2015, Pence signed legislation revising the law to protect against potential discrimination.[142] Pence received heavy criticism from liberals at the time of signing the religious freedom law, who labeled him as anti-gay. In 2018, emails released to the Associated Press showed that conservatives had also opposed his changing the law.[143] In March 2016, Pence, as Indiana governor, signed into law H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus' race or gender or a fetal abnormality. In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state.[144][145][146] The law was described as \"exceptional for its breadth\"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana \"the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome.\"[145] Days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial.[145] The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by United States 7th Circuit.[147] In June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he apologized.[148] On January 26, 2015, it was widely reported that Pence had planned to launch a state-run, taxpayer-funded news service for Indiana.[149] The service, called \"JustIN\", was to be overseen by a former reporter for The Indianapolis Star, and would feature breaking news, stories written by press secretaries, and light features.[149] At the time, it was reported that the two employees who would run the news service would be paid a combined $100,000 yearly salary.[149] The target audience was small newspapers which had limited staff, but the site would also serve to communicate directly with the public. The publisher of the Commercial Review of Portland, Indiana, said, \"I think it's a ludicrous idea\u00a0... the notion of elected officials presenting material that will inevitably have a pro-administration point of view is antithetical to the idea of an independent press.\"[149] There was speculation that the news service would publish pro-administration stories that would make Pence look good in the event of a presidential run.[150] According to Associated Press, the idea \"of stories prewritten for the media set off a wave of criticism from journalists around the country, who likened the Indiana endeavor to state-run media in Russia and China. Headlines like 'Pravda in the Plains' accompanied calls for Pence to scrap the idea.\"[151] David A. Graham of The Atlantic regarded the announcement of JustIN as evidence of a disturbing changing trend in how the public gets news.[152] After a week or so of controversy about the idea, Pence scrapped the idea saying, \"However well-intentioned, after thorough review of the preliminary planning and careful consideration of the concerns expressed, I am writing you to inform you that I have made a decision to terminate development of the JustIN website immediately.\"[153] As governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana.[154] In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence has appealed.[154] In December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional\".[155] Pence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright.\"[156][157][158] As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records. In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts.[159] While this use is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues.[160] In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure.[160] Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state.[160] In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence.[156] Pence ran for a second term as governor. He was unopposed in the May 3, 2016, Republican primary for governor. He was to face Democrat John R. Gregg, former speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, in a rematch of the 2012 race. However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate.[161] Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate.[162][163] Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election.[164] Pence endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.[57] Donald Trump considered naming Pence as his vice presidential running mate along with other finalists including New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich.[165] Pence had stronger connections at the time to the politically influential big donors, the Kochs, than Trump did.[166][167][168][169][170] As was widely reported on July 14, The Indianapolis Star wrote that Pence would end his re-election campaign and accept the Republican vice presidential nomination instead.[171] The following day, Trump officially announced on Twitter that Pence would be his running mate.[172][173][174] Immediately after the announcement, Pence said he was \"very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States\".[175] Pence said he was \"absolutely\" in sync with Trump's Mexican wall proposal, stating that Mexico was \"absolutely\" going to pay for it.[176] According to a FiveThirtyEight rating of candidates' ideology, Pence was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in the last forty years.[177] Pence said his role model as vice president would be Dick Cheney.[178] During Pence's preparations for the vice presidential debate in October 2016, Scott Walker played the role of Tim Kaine.[179] (In Kaine's own debate prep, Robert Barnett was selected to play Pence.)[180] In response to lewd comments made by Donald Trump in 2005,[181] and reported in The Washington Post on Friday, October 7, 2016, Pence said \"I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them\", but Pence made clear that he was standing by the presidential candidate.[182] The candidate's campaign substituted Pence for Trump at a campaign event from which Trump was \"uninvited\" by Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives.[183] According to The New York Times, Pence called Trump on October 8, 2016, and told him he would not appear at the campaign event with Ryan as a replacement for Trump and that Trump would need to handle the next 48 hours on his own, as Pence said he did not think he would be an effective surrogate for Trump.[184] On October 10, 2016, Pence appeared on CNN and said it was \"absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket\" and that it is the \"greatest honor of my life\" to be nominated as Trump's running mate.[185] According to Bob Woodward's 2018 book Fear: Trump in the White House, in the midst of the Access Hollywood tape scandal in October 2016, then Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told Trump he should drop out of the race for the good of the party and that Pence had agreed to replace Trump on the top of the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee and that former United States secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had agreed to be Pence's running mate.[186] On October 27, 2016, a chartered Boeing 737 carrying Pence skidded off a runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City and was slowed by an engineered materials arrestor system; no injuries were reported.[187] On November 8, 2016, Pence was elected vice president of the United States as Trump's running mate. Soon after the election, he was appointed chairman of President-elect Trump's transition team.[188] During the transition phase of the Trump administration, Pence was reported as holding a large degree of influence in the administration due to his roles as a mediator between Trump and congressional Republicans, for reassuring conservatives about Trump's conservative credentials, and his influence in determining Donald Trump's cabinet.[189][190] Pence is the sixth vice president from Indiana, following Schuyler Colfax (1869\u20131873), Thomas A. Hendricks (1885), Charles W. Fairbanks (1905\u20131909), Thomas R. Marshall (1913\u20131921) and Dan Quayle (1989\u20131993). On January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas, using Ronald Reagan's Bible, opened to 2 Chronicles 7:14, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land\", which is the same verse Reagan used for his swearing-ins as governor and president. Pence also used his personal Bible which he opens every morning.[191] On the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security.[192] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017.[193] Pence also sat in on calls made by President Trump to foreign heads of government and state such as Russian president Vladimir Putin[194] and Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.[195][196] In January, Pence appointed Josh Pitcock as his chief of staff, who he had known from his gubernatorial and congressional days.[197] The following month, Jarrod Agen was tapped as deputy assistant to the president and director of communications to the vice president; his previous job being chief of staff for governor of Michigan Rick Snyder through the time of the Flint water crisis.[198] In July, Pitcock stepped down as chief of staff, and was succeeded in the position by Nick Ayers, another longtime Pence advisor.[199] On February 7, 2017, Pence, in his dual constitutional role as president of the United States Senate made the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member.[200][201] He cast the deciding vote to break a fifty-fifty tie to confirm Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education.[202] Pence cast his second tie-breaking vote on March 30, voting to advance a bill to defund Planned Parenthood.[203] In 2018, Pence broke a tie to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This was the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. As of 2019[update], Pence has cast 13 tie-breaking votes, seventh-most in history and more than his previous four predecessors (Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, Al Gore and Dan Quayle) cast combined (Cheney broke eight ties, Gore broke four ties, and Quayle and Biden did not cast a tie-breaking vote). In April, Pence made a tour of the Asia-Pacific region. In South Korea, he met acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn and condemned North Korea's latest missile launch.[204][205][205][206] In Japan, Pence met Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe and pledged to work with Japan, South Korea, and China \"to achieve a peaceable resolution and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\" adding \"The era of strategic patience is over and while all options are on the table\".[207][208] Pence subsequently traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, where he met with president Joko Widodo, toured the largest mosque in the region (the Istiqlal Mosque), and praised moderate Islam.[209][210] Pence ended his trip with stops in Sydney, Australia (where, after meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, he said the U.S. \"intends to honor\" a U.S.\u2013Australia refugee resettlement agreement),[211] and Oahu, Hawaii and American Samoa.[212] On May 21, 2017, Pence delivered the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame. Traditionally, the president delivers the address at Notre Dame in his inaugural year, but in 2017 Pence was invited instead when Trump decided to speak at Liberty University.[213][214][215][216] On October 8, 2017, Pence walked out of a game between the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers at Trump's request after members of the 49ers knelt during the national anthem. Shortly afterwards, Pence commented via Twitter, \"President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem\"; further adding, \"While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I don't think its too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag and our national anthem.\"[217] Pence was widely criticized by various people for what was considered a publicity stunt. Democratic representative Adam Schiff (CA-28) questioned how much taxpayer's money was used to fund Pence's actions,[218] and it was later estimated that the cost of it all was about $242,500.[219] 49ers safety Eric Reid (the second NFL player after Colin Kaepernick to participate in the protests) told reporters it was predictable that Pence would walk out, knowing that most of the team were protesting.[218] Reid also expressed doubt over the regularity Pence is in terms of attending Colts matches, and referenced a photograph of the vice president and his wife in Colts uniform that had been tweeted before the match,[218] although the official photograph (right) proved otherwise. The photograph in question was first published in 2014.[220] Sportswriter Peter King wrote that the furor surrounding Pence had overshadowed Peyton Manning, who was being honored by the Colts, saying, \"Pence trumped a day that belonged to the greatest football hero the state of Indiana has ever seen, and he did it for political purposes\u00a0... he stole Manning's last great day as a Colt. [He] will have to live with himself for that.\"[218] The following year, Pence reacted positively on Twitter, after NFL owners unanimously decided to approve a new policy requiring all players to stand (or, given the option to stay in the locker room) during the national anthem, despite not consulting the NFL Players' Association.[221] On February 1, 2018, it was announced that Pence would lead the presidential delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, alongside his wife.[222] Much of Pence's time at PyeongChang was affected by the ongoing North Korean crisis. Prior to the opening ceremony, on February 9, Pence skipped on a dinner held by South Korean president Moon Jae-in, as he would have shared a table with North Korea's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam.[223] Instead, he met with four North Korean defectors in Pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, Fred Warmbier (the father of Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in North Korea for attempted theft, and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, before returning to the U.S. in a comatose state).[224][225][226] At the ceremony, the Pences were seated in front of the North Korean delegates, and when North and South Korean athletes entered during the Parade of Athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse Pence of hypocrisy in regards to the NFL protests.[227][228] Pence was supposed to meet with the North Koreans on February 10, but they pulled out at the last minute.[229] Over the next few months, the North Koreans started communicating more with their neighbors, as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un secretly met with Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping in March and then Moon Jae-in in an historic inter-Korean summit in April,[230][231] and around the same time, a meeting between Trump and Kim was also proposed. On May 10, Pence accompanied Trump to Andrews Air Force Base as three American citizens were released by North Korea, and in an early morning interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl, he said seeing the men back on American soil \"was really one of the greatest joys of my life.\"[232][233] Talks broke down later that month following comments made by Pence and Trump, comparing the situation to events in Libya seven years previous, despite their voluntary disarmament of nuclear weapons in 2003.[234] North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence's remarks \"ignorant and stupid\".[235] On May 24, Trump abruptly called off the summit with Pence in attendance,[234] only for him to change his mind a day later,[236] later announcing that it would still be scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore.[237] In May 2017, Pence filed FEC paperwork to form Great America Committee, a PAC that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst.[238][239] This is the only time a vice president has started his own PAC while still in office.[240] Pence denied a New York Times article's allegations that he will run for president in 2020, calling them \"laughable and absurd\", and said the article was \"disgraceful and offensive\".[241] Pence is a key player in the Trump-Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry. After the inquiry was opened, Pence publicly stated his support of Trump's call for foreign investigation into 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden, saying, \"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.\"[242] House committees have requested information from Biden regarding the executive branch's dealings with Ukraine. Pence has had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Pence told the press that he did not mention Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption.[243] Pence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate Iran's General Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Queda attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani, \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans.\" Pence insisted Soleimani, \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States,\" which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers, who actually numbered 19, and insinuating without evidence, that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated.[244] Pence's spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, 10 of whom \"were assisted by Soleimani\".[245] In June 2019, the Democratic former New York City Council President Andrew Stein opined that Trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing Pence as his running mate with former South Carolina Governor and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.[246] Despite that, Trump has said Pence will be his running mate, but declined to endorse Pence in 2019 should his running mate seek to succeed him, but said he would give it \"very strong consideration\".[247] Pence is described as being staunchly conservative on fiscal and social issues, with his political views strongly shaped by his Christian faith and by the conservative political theorist Russell Kirk.[1] During his acceptance speech for the nomination of Republican vice presidential candidate at the 2016 Republican National Convention he said, \"I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[248] As one commentator put it, \"Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve\u2014he wears the entire Jesus jersey.\"[16] Pence is an opponent of abortion, and his unwavering support of abortion restrictions has gained him the support of grassroots conservative activists.[249] He began seeking to defund Planned Parenthood in 2007[250] and in three congressional sessions, he introduced legislation to block organizations that provide abortion services from receiving any Title X funding, even for services not related to reproductive health or family planning.[251] Pence has criticized comprehensive sex education. In 2002, he criticized a speech by then-secretary of state Colin Powell, who had said it was \"important for young people\u00a0... to protect themselves from the possibility of acquiring any sexually transmitted disease\" through the use of condoms.[252][253] Pence called Powell's comments a \"sad day\" and expressed his support for abstinence education.[252][253] He asserted that \"condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases\" and that Powell was \"maybe inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives\".[252][253] Pence opposed President Obama's executive order eliminating restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research, saying, \"I believe it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research\u00a0... I believe it is morally wrong to take the tax dollars of millions of pro-life Americans.\"[254][255] He asserted that \"scientific breakthroughs have rendered embryonic stem-cell research obsolete\".[254][255] On January 27, 2017, Pence spoke at the March for Life in Washington D.C., becoming the first vice president and the highest-ranking United States official to ever speak at the annual event.[256][257] Pence has said he supports an overturn of Roe v. Wade, though denying that Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for that purpose.[258][259] Pence has been a vocal opponent of efforts to expand LGBT civil rights, during both his governorship and his tenure as a U.S. representative. In 2000 he said, \"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a 'discrete and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\"[260] Pence's 2000 congressional campaign website included text that called for \"an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus\" and instead advocated for resources to be directed toward institutions \"which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior\".[261][262][263][264] Pence has also been accused by LGBT rights advocates of endorsing conversion therapy, a charge he denies.[265] In 2007, Pence voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have banned workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[266] Pence opposed the 2009 Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act,[267] saying that Barack Obama wanted to \"advance a radical social agenda\"[268] and said that pastors \"could be charged or be subject to intimidation for simply expressing a Biblical worldview on the issue of homosexual behavior\".[269] Pence has said that homosexuals should not serve in the military, saying, \"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service because the presence of homosexuals in the ranks weakens unit cohesion.\"[270] Pence opposed the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" saying in 2010 that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military would \"have an impact on unit cohesion\".[270][271] Pence opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[272] While in the House, he said that \"societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family\".[273] He has advocated a constitutional same-sex marriage ban but did not champion such a proposed ban for his first year as governor.[274] Since entering politics, Pence has been widely condemned for his opposition to LGBT rights, by politicians, celebrities, and academics, who have accused Pence of promoting and encouraging homophobia and transphobia. Rolling Stone published an article in 2016 assailing Pence for his anti-LGBT and other actions as governor, and a book by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner condemned Pence as a \"Christian supremacist.\"[275][276] Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBT rights organization, has frequently censured Pence over his views on rights for the LGBT community, delivering a report in April 2018 that heavily excoriated Pence for his \"homophobic\" history.[277] Among the protests against Donald Trump, protesters have also targeted Pence; in May 2017, students at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, walked out of classes on the day of a speech delivered at the university by Pence, to protest Pence's anti-LGBT rhetoric.[278] In March 2018, Jill Twiss, a writer for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver wrote with Oliver a children's book about Pence's pet rabbit Marlon Bundo; the book's pro-LGBT themes and support of same-sex marriage were praised by LGBT rights groups and reviewers on Amazon, becoming a bestseller after it was published; the book aimed to disparage Pence for his anti-LGBT rhetoric, and spoofed Charlotte Pence's children's book about the rabbit following her father around on a day as vice president, Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President.[279][280] Pence's daughter Charlotte expressed her support for the parody book and the charities both books benefitted.[281] During the 2018 Winter Olympics held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, openly gay figure skater Adam Rippon declined an invitation to a meeting with Pence in Pyeongchang, citing Pence's anti-LGBT history and alleged support for conversion therapy.[282] When Pence was made aware of Rippon's statement, he published a response on Twitter calling the charge of supporting conversion therapy \"fake news.\"[283] John Oliver berated Pence for his hostility towards LGBT citizens and accused him of lying in his denials of supporting conversion therapy by pointing out Pence's longtime friendship with evangelist and anti-LGBT activist James Dobson, who promoted conversion therapy.[284] Following the tweet, the New York Times brought attention to a statement from Pence's campaign website in 2000: \"Resources should be directed towards those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\" The statement was interpreted as evidence of hypocrisy by Pence, which generated heavy criticism from the medical and LGBT community, though a Pence spokeswoman in January said the \"accusation is totally false\" citing that changing \u201csexual behavior\u201d referred to Pence\u2019s support of the Ryan White CARE Act which encourages safe sex practices to combat HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. [285][286] The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler has called the allegations that Pence supported conversion therapy as \"a dubious assumption\", while other media such as CNN promoted the allegations as truthful.[287] Pence's legislative history regarding LGBT rights has also come under political criticism. South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay, described Pence in August 2018 as \"a social extremist.\"[288] In June 2018, Pence visited Philadelphia. Prior to his arrival in the city, openly gay lawmaker Brian Sims, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 182nd district, posted a message and accompanying photo on Facebook of himself giving the middle finger to Pence, with the caption beneath the photo containing a statement denouncing Pence and his views on LGBT rights.[289] The posting of the image quickly drew controversy; while progressive commentators and media outlets lauded Sims for the message, right-wing and conservative sources were critical of Sims and the post, accusing him of lacking basic respect for the vice president; Sims responded on Twitter to the negative press by individually mocking detractors of the post and accusing them of supporting Donald Trump's alleged sexual assaults of women (which came to light following the release of a recording of Trump making obscene comments about women in 2016), and the controversial separations of immigrant families at the southern border conducted under the Trump administration.[289] Pence faced other protests and opposition during his visit to Philadelphia. In January 2019, Pence's wife, Second Lady Karen Pence announced that she would return to teaching at Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C. The announcement drew immediate controversy based on Immanuel Christian School's code of conduct, which included that the school would refuse admission to students who were involved in or who had tolerated \"sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity.\" After Second Lady Pence and the school were condemned by the media, Pence defended his wife, stating in an interview, \"To see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us.\" Pence was in turn condemned for the defense; on January 19, singer and LGBT activist Lady Gaga denounced the Pences and Immanuel Christian School at a concert in Las Vegas, stating that Pence believes \"it's acceptable that his wife works at a school that bans LGBTQ. You are wrong!\", among other related statements.[290][291][292] In March 2019, former Vice President Joe Biden referred to Pence as \"a decent guy\" during a speech at the University of Nebraska Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska, a month before Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign. LGBT groups, progressive leaders and celebrities strongly criticized him, with actress and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon chastising Biden on Twitter, to which Biden responded by apologizing and criticizing Pence's stance on LGBT rights. Nixon later penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Pence \"insidious and dangerous\" for his actions on LGBT rights, also condemning Pence's actions against abortion as Governor of Indiana and accusing the Vice President of continuing to support conversion therapy, writing that \"It's easy to say nice things about Pence when you're not personally threatened by his agenda. If Biden were being directly attacked in the same way that our community is, I think he would see Pence from a very different vantage point.\"[293][294] Pence was a co-sponsor of H.J.Res.73, a 2011 spending limit amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment would limit federal spending to \"the average annual revenue collected in the three prior years, adjusted in proportion to changes in population and inflation\".[295] In regards to adopting the gold standard, Pence said in 2011, \"the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nation's monetary affairs\".[296] Pence proposed legislation to end the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve (maximizing employment and stabilizing prices), requiring the Fed to just focus on price stability and not full employment.[297][298] He has been a proponent of a flat federal tax rate.[299] Pence opposed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) (the \"Wall Street bailout\") of 2008.[299] Pence also opposed the auto industry rescue package of 2008\u201309, which guided General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy.[300] In 2007, Pence voted against raising the federal minimum wage to $7.25 (from $5.15) an hour over two years, saying it would \"hurt the working poor\".[81] While in the House, Pence voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (\"card check\").[82] He voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[301] He had publicly opposed the bill[302] denouncing it as a failure, and called for a federal spending freeze.[303] Nevertheless, several months after voting against the bill, Pence privately sought $6\u00a0million in stimulus funds for projects in his district,[304] and in 2010, hosted a job fair for stimulus-backed employers.[305] A Pence spokesperson said that \"once it became law, he had a responsibility to support local efforts to secure funding for projects that could benefit people in his district\".[304] Pence voted against the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[306] Pence was a supporter of earmark reform. He voted against the $139.7\u00a0billion Transportation-Treasury spending bill in June 2006, and in favor of a series of amendments proposed that same month by Jeff Flake which would strip other members' earmarks from the federal budget.[307] On occasion, however, Pence secured earmarks for projects in his district.[307] Pence voted against the act that created Medicare Part\u00a0D (a prescription drug benefit)[42] and against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[308] In June 2012, after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius, Pence likened the ruling to the September 11 terrorist attacks in a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference. He immediately apologized for making the statement.[309] In 2001, Pence wrote an op-ed arguing against the tobacco settlement and tobacco regulation, saying they would create \"new government bureaucracies\" and encroach on private lives. He said that \"despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill\".[121][310] Pence asserted, \"two out of every three smokers does [sic] not die from a smoking related illness and nine out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer\", while acknowledging that \"smoking isn't good for you\" and people who smoke should quit.[121][310] In 2009, Pence voted against the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which allows the FDA to regulate tobacco products.[311] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pence's state of Indiana has one of the worst smoking problems in America.[254] Pence was slow to support a needle exchange program in Indiana to combat an HIV outbreak related to needle-sharing among opioid drug users. While giving credit for the program's ultimate start, an AIDS research foundation director of public policy later deemed the outbreak \"entirely preventable\". The state's health commissioner defended Pence's speed at responding to the situation.[312] In June 2006, Pence unveiled an immigration plan (which he described as \"No Amnesty Immigration reform\") that would include increased border security, followed by strict enforcement of laws against hiring illegal aliens, and a guest worker program. This guest worker program would have required participants to apply from their home country to government-approved job placement agencies that match workers with employers who cannot find Americans for the job.[313] The plan received support from conservatives such as Dick Armey,[314] but attracted criticism from other conservatives such as Richard Viguerie and paleoconservatives Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan, who, as described by The New York Times, collectively viewed Pence as lending \"his conservative prestige to a form of liberal amnesty\".[14][315] In 2009, Pence opposed birthright citizenship (the legal principle set forth by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\"). He co-sponsored a bill that would have limited citizenship to children born to at least one parent who is a citizen, immigrants living permanently in the U.S. or non-citizens performing active service in the Armed Forces.[316] In 2010, Pence voted against the DREAM Act, which would grant the undocumented children of illegal immigrants conditional non-immigrant status if they met certain requirements.[317] In 2010, Pence said Arizona S.B. 1070, which at the time of passage in 2010 was the nation's broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration legislation, was \"a good faith to try and restore order to their communities\".[318] Pence supported President George W. Bush's unsuccessful 2005 proposal to partially privatize Social Security[319] by allowing workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in private investment accounts and reduce the increase in benefits for high-income participants.[320] Pence had previously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush's.[320] When asked in 2010 if he would be willing to make cuts to Social Security, Pence answered, \"I think everything has to be on the table.\"[320] When asked if he would raise the retirement age, he said, \"I'm an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu.\"[320] Pence supported the Patriot Act on its passage in 2001,[321] and in 2005 called the act \"essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home\".[322] Pence was a sponsor of legislation in 2009 to extend three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act (the library records provision, the roving-wiretap provision, and the lone-wolf provision) for an additional ten years.[323] Pence \"has been a longtime, aggressive advocate of trade deals\" between the U.S. and foreign countries.[324] Pence has been a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),[324] and during his tenure in the House, he voted for every free-trade agreement that came before him.[325] Pence voted in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); in favor of keeping the U.S. in the World Trade Organization; and in favor of permanent normal trade relations with China.[325] Pence also supported bilateral free-trade agreements with Colombia, South Korea, Panama, Peru, Oman, Chile and Singapore.[325] Pence's strong stance in favor of free trade sharply differs from the stance of his running mate Trump, who has condemned globalization and the liberalization of trade.[324][325] Pence voted against the Trade and Globalization Act of 2007, which would have expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance to American workers adversely affected by globalization.[326] However, in 2014 Pence called for the \"swift adoption\" of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), urging Indiana's congressional delegation to support the trade deal.[324] Pence supported the Iraq War Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq.[327] During the Iraq War, Pence opposed setting a public withdrawal date from Iraq. During an April 2007 visit to Baghdad, Pence and John McCain visited Shorja market, the site of a deadly attack in February 2007 which had claimed 61 lives. Pence and McCain described the visit as evidence that the security situation in Iraqi markets had improved.[328] The visit to the market took place under tight security, including helicopters overhead, and the New York Times reported that the visit gave a false indication of how secure the area was because of the extremely heavy security forces protecting McCain.[329] Pence chaired the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush's Iraq War troop surge of 2007. At the time, Pence said \"the surge is working\" and defended the initial decision to invade in 2003.[327] Pence has opposed closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and trying the suspected terrorists in the United States.[330] As an alternative, Pence has said the \"enemy combatants\" should be tried in a military tribunal.[330] Pence has stated his support of Israel and its right to attack facilities in Iran to prevent the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons, has defended the actions of Israel in its use of deadly force in enforcing the blockade of Gaza, and has referred to Israel as \"America's most cherished ally\".[331] He visited Israel in 2014 to express his support, and in 2016 signed into law a bill which would ban Indiana from having any commercial dealings with a company that boycotts Israel.[332] He opposes a Palestinian state.[333] Pence criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama's alleged weak leadership, saying: \"When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts. That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership.\"[334] Two weeks prior to the NATO intervention in Libya, Pence thanked the Obama administration and secretary of state Hillary Clinton for their efforts to isolate the Gaddafi regime.[335][336][337] Pence expressed support for \"a no-fly zone\" and said \"Gaddafi must go.\"[335][336][337] Pence condemned the \"terrible savagery\" against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, saying \"The images of the violence and its victims have shocked the American people, and decent people all over the world\".[338] Pence called on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to release Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in the post-coup purges in Turkey,[339] or face significant sanctions.[340] On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on two senior Turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of Brunson.[341][342] Erdo\u011fan said the U.S. behavior will force Turkey to look for new friends and allies.[343] On July 26, 2018, Pence raised the Xinjiang re-education camps issue at Ministerial To Advance Religious Freedom.[344] He said that \"Sadly, as we speak as well, Beijing is holding hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of Uyghur Muslims in so-called 're-education camps', where they're forced to endure around-the-clock political indoctrination and to denounce their religious beliefs and their cultural identity as the goal.\"[345] Pence \"does not accept the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of climate change.\"[346] In 2001, Pence wrote in an op-ed that \"global warming is a myth,\" saying that \"the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago\".[347][348] In 2006 and 2009, Pence expressed the view that it was unclear whether global warming was driven by human activity, and in 2009 he told political commentator Chris Matthews that there was a \"growing skepticism in the scientific community about global warming\".[349][350] In 2009, Pence led the Republican effort to defeat the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman-Markey), a Democratic-backed bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions (and therefore combat climate change) through a cap-and-trade system.[346] On September 27, 2016, however, Pence said \"there's no question\" that human activity affects both the climate and the environment.[351] Pence holds a lifetime rating of four percent from the League of Conservation Voters.[352] While in the House, Pence \"voted to eliminate funding for climate education programs and to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions\".[108] Pence also \"repeatedly voted against energy efficiency and renewable energy funding and rules\" and voted \"for several bills that supported fossil fuel development, including legislation promoting offshore drilling\".[108] Pence has questioned proposals to decrease penalties for low-level marijuana offenses in Indiana, saying the state should focus on \"reducing crime, not reducing penalties\".[353] In 2013, Pence expressed concern that a then-pending bill to revise the state's criminal code was not tough enough on drug crimes, and successfully lobbied to limit the reduction in sentencing of marijuana offenses.[354] In 2016, he signed into law a measure that would reinstate a ten-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for certain drug offenders.[355][356] During 2014, Pence sent a letter to United States Attorney General Eric Holder, saying Indiana would not comply with federal prison rape elimination standards because they were \"too expensive\". According to the Indiana Department of Corrections, it would cost the state $15\u201320\u00a0million annually to comply with the guidelines. Pence said a number of rape prevention measures had already been \"implemented\".[357] In 2015, Pence signed Senate Bill 94 to lengthen the statute of limitations for rape\u2014continuing for five years after sufficient DNA evidence is uncovered, enough recorded evidence is brought forth or discovered, or the offender confesses to the crime.[358] Pence also signed Senate Bill\u00a08 to allow the death penalty for beheadings if the victim was alive at the time of the offense.[358]Pence has been an advocate of federal restrictions on online gambling. In 2006, he was one of 35 cosponsors of H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte\u2013Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,[359] and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[360] Pence praised the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission when it was announced. Pence said: Freedom won today in the Supreme Court. Today's ruling in the Citizens United case takes us one step closer to the Founding Fathers' vision of free speech, a vision that is cherished by all Americans and one Congress has a responsibility to protect. If the freedom of speech means anything, it means protecting the right of private citizens to voice opposition or support for their elected representatives. The fact that the court overturned a 20-year precedent speaks volumes about the importance of this issue.[361]Pence described the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known as McCain\u2013Feingold, which regulates the financing of political campaigns, as \"oppressive restrictions on free speech\".[362] In the late 1990s, Pence put forth support for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton due to lying about an affair Clinton had as president, but also further argued for the moral requirements of the office of the presidency. Pence wrote that an American president with \"bad moral habits\" can \"incinerate the planet\", thus nothing less than a president who represents \"all of our highest hopes and ideals and values\" could be accepted. Pence also brought up \"staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce\" mandating that \"America needs to be able to look to her First Family as role models\".[363][364] After becoming vice president, Pence remained mostly silent on allegations that President Trump had extramarital affairs before his presidency with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, but on one occasion called Daniels' allegations \"baseless\".[363][364] Mike and Karen Pence have been married since 1985. The two met while he was in law school at Indiana University.[16] They have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.[365][366] During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses.[11][20] Pence's son, Michael, is a first lieutenant and training to be a pilot in the United States Marine Corps.[367][368] Pence has five siblings. His oldest brother, Greg, ran in 2018 to represent Indiana's 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike), and won.[369][370] Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother, Nancy, a widow with four grown children and two teenagers. On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother married Basil Coolidge Fritsch, a widower since 2001.[371][372] The Pences have four pets: a cat, a dog, a rabbit, and a snake.[373] Their rabbit, named Marlon Bundo, was featured in two children's books, both released in March 2018. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was written by Jill Twiss and released on March 18, 2018.[374] Marlon Bundo's: A Day in the Life of the Vice President was written by Charlotte and released on March 19, 2018.[375] Pence was raised in a Catholic family, served as an altar server, and attended parochial school.[4][376] He became a born-again Christian in college, while a member of a nondenominational Christian student group, and identified his first year\u2014and specifically \"a Christian music festival in Asbury, Kentucky, in the spring of 1978\"[377] referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky\u2014as the moment he made a \"commitment to Christ.\"[4][376] After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister.[376] Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church.[4][376] In 2013, Pence said his family was \"kind of looking for a church.\"[4] He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\" and as \"a born-again, evangelical Catholic.\"[4][376] When asked by Chris Matthews in 2009 if he believed in evolution, Pence said \"I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. How he did that, I'll ask him about some day.\"[254][349] In a 2002 statement on the floor of the House of Representatives (reported in the Congressional Record), Pence told his colleagues \"...\u00a0I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\"[378][379] Pence adheres to the Billy Graham rule, in which husbands avoid spending time alone with women to whom they are not married.[380][381] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

After losing two bids for a U.S. congressional seat in 1988 and 1990, he became a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. Pence was elected to the United States Congress in 2000 and represented Indiana's 2nd congressional district and Indiana's 6th congressional district in the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. He served as the chairman of the House Republican Conference from 2009 to 2011.[2] Pence described himself as a \"principled conservative\" and supporter of the Tea Party movement,[3] stating that he was \"a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[4]\nPence successfully sought the Republican nomination for the 2012 Indiana gubernatorial election when term-limited Mitch Daniels retired. He defeated former speaker John R. Gregg in the closest gubernatorial election in 50 years.[5][6] Upon becoming governor in January 2013, Pence initiated the largest tax cut in Indiana's history and pushed for more funding for education initiatives. Pence signed bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetus's race, gender, or disability.[7] After Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), he encountered fierce resistance from moderate members of his party, the business community, and LGBT advocates. The backlash against the RFRA led Pence to amend the bill to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and other criteria.\nPence was inaugurated as vice president of the United States on January 20, 2017. He had withdrawn his gubernatorial reelection campaign in July to become the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who went on to win the presidential election on November 8, 2016.\nMichael Richard Pence was born June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Nancy Jane (n\u00e9e Cawley) and Edward Joseph Pence Jr.,[8][9] who ran a group of gas stations.[10][11] His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph.[12] His maternal family were Irish Catholic Democrats.[13] Pence was named after his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from County Sligo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island, following an aunt and his brother James, and became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois.[14][15][16][17] His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare.[18][19]\nPence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a BA degree in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a JD degree from the Indiana University's Robert H. McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis in 1986.[20] While at Hanover, Pence joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he became the chapter president.[21] After graduating from Hanover, Pence was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983.[22]\nIn his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat. He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election,[1][16] and has said he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[1] While in college, Pence became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the great disappointment of his mother.[1][16] His political views also started shifting to the right during this time in his life, something which Pence attributes to the \"common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan\" with which he began to identify.[1][23]\nAfter graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice.[24] He ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in 1988 and in 1990. In 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network, a position he held until 1993.[25][26][27]\nShortly after his first congressional campaign in 1988, radio station WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana, hired Pence to host a weekly half-hour radio show, Washington Update with Mike Pence.[28] In 1992, Pence began hosting a daily talk show on WRCR, The Mike Pence Show, in addition to a Saturday show on WNDE in Indianapolis.[25][28][29][30] Pence called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as bombastic as Limbaugh.[31][32] Beginning on April 11, 1994, Network Indiana syndicated The Mike Pence Show statewide.[33] With a 9:00\u00a0a.m. to noon (ET) time slot, the program reached as many as 18 radio stations in Indiana, including WIBC in Indianapolis.[25] Pence ended his radio show in September 1999 to focus on his 2000 campaign for Congress, which he eventually won.[34] From 1995 to 1999, Pence hosted a weekend public affairs TV show also titled The Mike Pence Show on Indianapolis TV station WNDY.[28][35]\nIn 1988, Pence ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost.[36] He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful.[36] During the race, Pence used \"political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife.\"[37] While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign.[37]\nDuring the 1990 campaign, Pence ran a television advertisement in which an actor, dressed in a robe and headdress and speaking in a thick Middle Eastern accent, thanked his opponent, Sharp, for doing nothing to wean the United States off imported oil as chairman of a House subcommittee on energy and power.[37][38] In response to criticism, Pence's campaign responded that the ad was not about Arabs; rather, it concerned Sharp's lack of leadership.[37][38] In 1991, Pence wrote an essay, \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner\", published in the Indiana Policy Review, in which he apologized for running negative ads against Sharp.[31][37][39]\nMike Pence rejuvenated his political career by running for the U.S. House of Representatives again in 2000, this time winning the seat in Indiana's 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent David M. McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana. The district (renumbered as Indiana's 6th congressional district beginning in 2002) comprises all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana. As a congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\"[4] While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus.[40]\nIn his first year in office, Pence opposed President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act in 2001,[41] as well as President Bush's Medicare prescription drug expansion the following year.[42] Pence was re-elected four more times by comfortable margins. In the 2006, 2008, and 2010 House elections, he defeated Democrat Barry Welsh.[43][44][45]\nPence began to climb the party leadership structure and from 2005 to 2007 was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans.[46] In November 2006, Pence announced his candidacy for leader of the Republican Party (minority leader) in the United States House of Representatives.[47] Pence's release announcing his run for minority leader focused on a \"return to the values\" of the Newt Gingrich-headed 1994 Republican Revolution.[47] However, he lost the bid to Representative John Boehner of Ohio by a vote of 168 for Boehner, 27 for Pence, and one for Representative Joe Barton of Texas.[48] In January 2009, Pence was elected as the Republican Conference chairman, the third-highest-ranking Republican leadership position. He ran unopposed and was elected unanimously. He was the first representative from Indiana to hold a House leadership position since 1981.[2] During Pence's twelve years in the House, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions; none became law.[49] His committee assignments in the House were the following:\nIn 2008, Esquire magazine listed Pence as one of the ten best members of Congress, writing that Pence's \"unalloyed traditional conservatism has repeatedly pitted him against his party elders.\"[56] Pence was mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for president in 2008[57] and 2012.[58] In September 2010, he was the top choice for president in a straw poll conducted by the Values Voter Summit.[59][60] That same year he was encouraged to run against incumbent Democratic senator Evan Bayh,[61][62][63] but opted not to enter the race,[64] even after Bayh unexpectedly announced that he would retire.[65]\nIn May 2011, Mike Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012.[66] Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. He ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels.[67][68] Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote and less than 3% ahead of Democrat John R. Gregg, and trailed by Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham.[69] Pence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.[70]\nPence \"inherited a $2\u00a0billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state\u00a0... added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections.\"[71] The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2\u00a0billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14\u00a0billion annual state budget include $24\u00a0million cut from colleges and universities; $27\u00a0million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA);[72] and $12\u00a0million cut from the Department of Correction.[73] During Pence's term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average.[74] Indiana's job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend.[75] In 2014, Indiana's economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector.[76] Carrier Corp. and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves[77] and Pence expressed \"deep disappointment\".[78][79] Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received.[79][80] The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24\u00a0million in incentives to 10 companies who sent jobs abroad. $8.7\u00a0million had been paid out by August 2016.[77]\nIn 2013, Pence signed a law blocking local governments in Indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law. In 2015, Pence also repealed an Indiana law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage.[81][82][83][84] Indiana enacted right-to-work legislation under Pence's predecessor, Republican governor Mitch Daniels. Under Pence, the state successfully defended this legislation against a labor challenge.[82] In 2013, Pence also announced the formation of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, a life sciences research facility supported with $25\u00a0million in startup funds from the state.[85]\nPence made tax reform, namely a 10 percent income-tax rate cut, a priority for 2013.[86][87] While he did not get the 10 percent cut he advocated, Pence did accomplish his goal of cutting state taxes.[86] Legislators cut the income tax by five percent and also killed the inheritance tax.[86] Speaker of the House Brian Bosma said the legislative package was the \"largest tax cut in our state's history, about $1.1\u00a0billion dollars.\"[88] By signing Senate Bill 1, the state corporate income tax would be dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by 2021, which would be the second-lowest corporate income tax in the nation.[89] The law also permitted Indiana counties to eliminate the business personal property tax on new equipment and let them exempt small businesses with less than $20,000 worth of equipment from paying personal property taxes.[89]\nOn June 12, 2013, the Indiana Legislature overrode Pence's veto of a bill to retroactively authorize a local tax. Lawmakers overrode Pence's veto in a 68\u201323 vote in the House and a 34\u201312 one in the Senate.[90] Republican legislators overwhelmingly voted against Pence, while most Democrats supported his veto.[91] The Jackson\u2013Pulaski tax fix, one of three bills vetoed by Pence during the session, addressed a 15-year-old county income tax which had been imposed to fund the construction of jail facilities with the stipulation that the tax be lowered by one percent after the first several years. The reduction was not implemented and thus county residents paid an additional one percent tax that they were legally not required to pay. The bill, which was passed by a huge majority of legislators and subsequently vetoed by Pence, allowed money to be kept and not returned to the taxpayers as would have otherwise been necessary.[91][92]\nAs governor, Pence pressed for a balanced budget amendment to the state's constitution. He initially proposed the initiative in his State of the State address in January 2015. The legislation passed the state Senate.[93] Indiana has had AAA credit ratings with the three major credit-rating agencies since 2010, before Pence took office; these ratings were maintained throughout Pence's tenure.[94]\nIn 2014, Pence supported the Indiana Gateway project,[95] a $71.4\u00a0million passenger and freight rail improvement initiative paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus package), which Pence had voted against while a congressman.[96] In October 2015, Pence \"announced plans to pay off a $250\u00a0million federal loan\" to cover unemployment insurance payments which had spiked during the recession.[71] In March 2016, Pence signed legislation to fund a $230\u00a0million two-year road-funding package.[71]\nDuring his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools.[97][98] In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10\u00a0million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan.[97][98] Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool.\"[98] Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80\u00a0million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding,[97] arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion.\"[99] After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds.[97][100]\nIn 2015, Pence secured significant increases in charter-school funding from the legislation, although he did not get everything he had proposed.[98] Legislation signed into law by Pence in 2013 greatly increased the number of students in Indiana who qualify for school vouchers, making it one of the largest voucher programs in the United States.[101][102][103][104] The annual cost of the program is estimated to be $53\u00a0million for the 2015\u201316 school year.[103][104]\nPence opposed the Common Core State Standards Initiative, calling for the repeal of the standards in his 2014 State of the State address. The Indiana General Assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so.[97][98]\nDespite successful advocacy for more funding for pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, Pence has frequently clashed with teachers unions and supporters of public schooling.[97][98] In one of his first acts as governor, Pence removed control of the Educational Employment Relations Board, which was in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards, from Glenda Ritz, a Democrat who was the Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction (a separately elected position in the state).[105] Pence created a new \"Center for Education and Career Innovation\" (CECI) to coordinate efforts between schools and the private sector; Ritz opposed the Center, viewing it as a \"power grab\" and encroachment on her own duties. Pence eventually disestablished the Center in order to help defuse the conflict.[97][98] In May 2015, Pence signed a bill stripping Ritz of much of her authority over standardized testing and other education issues, and reconstituting the State Board of Education dominated by Pence appointees.[106] The bill also allowed the board to appoint a chairman other than the Superintendent of Public Instruction starting in 2017, and added the State Board of Education (controlled by Pence) as a \"state educational authority\" along with the Department of Education (controlled by Ritz) for purposes of accessing sensitive student data.[106] Pence and Ritz also clashed over non-binding federal guidelines that advised Indiana public schools must treat transgender students in a way that corresponds to their gender identity, even if their education files indicate a different gender.[107]\nDuring Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly \"repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts.\"[108] Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy,\" and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.\"[108][109] In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan.[108][110] Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan.[108] In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.[111]\nIn 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property.[112] In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry. Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue.[113] In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns.[114][115] The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana Attorney General Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government.\"[115] In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in Indiana.[116]\nIn 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site. Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency;[117] his successor Governor Eric Holcomb has issued Executive Order 17-13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago.[118][119] The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997.[120]\nBeginning in December 2014, there was an HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana.[121] In 2011, Planned Parenthood ran five rural clinics in Indiana. They tested for HIV and offered prevention, intervention and counseling for better health. The one in Scott County performed no abortions.[122] The Republican-controlled legislature and Pence defunded Planned Parenthood.[123] Scott County has been without an HIV testing center since 2013.[122] Pence had long been a vocal opponent of needle exchange programs, which allow drug users to trade in used syringes for sterile ones in order to stop the spread of diseases, despite evidence that such programs prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C, and do not increase drug abuse.[121]\nIn March 2015, after the outbreak began, Pence allowed at least five counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges.[121] Critics say Pence's compromise has been ineffective because counties had no way to pay for needle exchanges themselves. Indiana State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams defended Pence, saying that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities.[124]\nIn 2015, Pence and the Obama administration agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.[125][126] As part of the expansion, called the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, Pence negotiated modifications to the program for Indiana that included co-payments by participants. The co-payments are linked to healthy behaviors on the part of the participants so that, for example, a participant who quit smoking would receive a lower co-payment. Participants can lose benefits for failing to make the payments.[127] The required contribution would be about 2% of income. Critics say those who already struggle to buy food and housing will have even more difficulty paying their 2%. One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. A service provider said the program \"wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape.\"[128] In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. National Public Radio/Side Effects Public Media said the application used \"misleading and inaccurate information.\"[129]\nOn March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana \"religious objections\" bill (Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA), into law.[130] The law's signing was met with criticism by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons.[131][132][133][134] Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with Salesforce.com saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state.[135][136] Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40\u00a0million expansion of their Indianapolis based headquarters over concerns with the law. The expansion would have moved 1000 jobs into the state.[137] Thousands protested against the policy.[131] Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the \"wrong signal\" about the state.[138]\nPence defended the law, saying it was not about discrimination. In an appearance on the ABC News program This Week with George Stephanopoulos[139] he said, \"We are not going to change this law,\" while refusing to answer whether examples of discrimination against LGBT people given by Eric Miller of anti-LGBT group Advance America would be legal under the law.[140] Pence denied the law permitted discrimination and wrote in a March 31, 2015, Wall Street Journal op-ed, \"If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn't eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it.\"[141] In the wake of the backlash against the RFRA, on April 2, 2015, Pence signed legislation revising the law to protect against potential discrimination.[142] Pence received heavy criticism from liberals at the time of signing the religious freedom law, who labeled him as anti-gay. In 2018, emails released to the Associated Press showed that conservatives had also opposed his changing the law.[143]\nIn March 2016, Pence, as Indiana governor, signed into law H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus' race or gender or a fetal abnormality. In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state.[144][145][146] The law was described as \"exceptional for its breadth\"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana \"the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome.\"[145] Days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial.[145] The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by United States 7th Circuit.[147]\nIn June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he apologized.[148]\nOn January 26, 2015, it was widely reported that Pence had planned to launch a state-run, taxpayer-funded news service for Indiana.[149] The service, called \"JustIN\", was to be overseen by a former reporter for The Indianapolis Star, and would feature breaking news, stories written by press secretaries, and light features.[149] At the time, it was reported that the two employees who would run the news service would be paid a combined $100,000 yearly salary.[149] The target audience was small newspapers which had limited staff, but the site would also serve to communicate directly with the public. The publisher of the Commercial Review of Portland, Indiana, said, \"I think it's a ludicrous idea\u00a0... the notion of elected officials presenting material that will inevitably have a pro-administration point of view is antithetical to the idea of an independent press.\"[149] There was speculation that the news service would publish pro-administration stories that would make Pence look good in the event of a presidential run.[150]\nAccording to Associated Press, the idea \"of stories prewritten for the media set off a wave of criticism from journalists around the country, who likened the Indiana endeavor to state-run media in Russia and China. Headlines like 'Pravda in the Plains' accompanied calls for Pence to scrap the idea.\"[151] David A. Graham of The Atlantic regarded the announcement of JustIN as evidence of a disturbing changing trend in how the public gets news.[152] After a week or so of controversy about the idea, Pence scrapped the idea saying, \"However well-intentioned, after thorough review of the preliminary planning and careful consideration of the concerns expressed, I am writing you to inform you that I have made a decision to terminate development of the JustIN website immediately.\"[153]\nAs governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana.[154] In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence has appealed.[154]\nIn December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional\".[155]\nPence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright.\"[156][157][158] As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records. In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts.[159] While this use is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues.[160] In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure.[160] Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state.[160] In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence.[156]\nPence ran for a second term as governor. He was unopposed in the May 3, 2016, Republican primary for governor. He was to face Democrat John R. Gregg, former speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, in a rematch of the 2012 race. However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate.[161] Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate.[162][163] Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election.[164]\nPence endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.[57]\nDonald Trump considered naming Pence as his vice presidential running mate along with other finalists including New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich.[165] Pence had stronger connections at the time to the politically influential big donors, the Kochs, than Trump did.[166][167][168][169][170] As was widely reported on July 14, The Indianapolis Star wrote that Pence would end his re-election campaign and accept the Republican vice presidential nomination instead.[171] The following day, Trump officially announced on Twitter that Pence would be his running mate.[172][173][174]\nImmediately after the announcement, Pence said he was \"very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States\".[175] Pence said he was \"absolutely\" in sync with Trump's Mexican wall proposal, stating that Mexico was \"absolutely\" going to pay for it.[176]\nAccording to a FiveThirtyEight rating of candidates' ideology, Pence was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in the last forty years.[177]\nPence said his role model as vice president would be Dick Cheney.[178]\nDuring Pence's preparations for the vice presidential debate in October 2016, Scott Walker played the role of Tim Kaine.[179] (In Kaine's own debate prep, Robert Barnett was selected to play Pence.)[180]\nIn response to lewd comments made by Donald Trump in 2005,[181] and reported in The Washington Post on Friday, October 7, 2016, Pence said \"I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them\", but Pence made clear that he was standing by the presidential candidate.[182] The candidate's campaign substituted Pence for Trump at a campaign event from which Trump was \"uninvited\" by Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives.[183]\nAccording to The New York Times, Pence called Trump on October 8, 2016, and told him he would not appear at the campaign event with Ryan as a replacement for Trump and that Trump would need to handle the next 48 hours on his own, as Pence said he did not think he would be an effective surrogate for Trump.[184] On October 10, 2016, Pence appeared on CNN and said it was \"absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket\" and that it is the \"greatest honor of my life\" to be nominated as Trump's running mate.[185]\nAccording to Bob Woodward's 2018 book Fear: Trump in the White House, in the midst of the Access Hollywood tape scandal in October 2016, then Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told Trump he should drop out of the race for the good of the party and that Pence had agreed to replace Trump on the top of the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee and that former United States secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had agreed to be Pence's running mate.[186]\nOn October 27, 2016, a chartered Boeing 737 carrying Pence skidded off a runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City and was slowed by an engineered materials arrestor system; no injuries were reported.[187]\nOn November 8, 2016, Pence was elected vice president of the United States as Trump's running mate.\nSoon after the election, he was appointed chairman of President-elect Trump's transition team.[188] During the transition phase of the Trump administration, Pence was reported as holding a large degree of influence in the administration due to his roles as a mediator between Trump and congressional Republicans, for reassuring conservatives about Trump's conservative credentials, and his influence in determining Donald Trump's cabinet.[189][190]\nPence is the sixth vice president from Indiana, following Schuyler Colfax (1869\u20131873), Thomas A. Hendricks (1885), Charles W. Fairbanks (1905\u20131909), Thomas R. Marshall (1913\u20131921) and Dan Quayle (1989\u20131993).\nOn January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas, using Ronald Reagan's Bible, opened to 2 Chronicles 7:14, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land\", which is the same verse Reagan used for his swearing-ins as governor and president. Pence also used his personal Bible which he opens every morning.[191]\nOn the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security.[192] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017.[193]\nPence also sat in on calls made by President Trump to foreign heads of government and state such as Russian president Vladimir Putin[194] and Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.[195][196]\nIn January, Pence appointed Josh Pitcock as his chief of staff, who he had known from his gubernatorial and congressional days.[197] The following month, Jarrod Agen was tapped as deputy assistant to the president and director of communications to the vice president; his previous job being chief of staff for governor of Michigan Rick Snyder through the time of the Flint water crisis.[198] In July, Pitcock stepped down as chief of staff, and was succeeded in the position by Nick Ayers, another longtime Pence advisor.[199]\nOn February 7, 2017, Pence, in his dual constitutional role as president of the United States Senate made the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member.[200][201] He cast the deciding vote to break a fifty-fifty tie to confirm Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education.[202] Pence cast his second tie-breaking vote on March 30, voting to advance a bill to defund Planned Parenthood.[203] In 2018, Pence broke a tie to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This was the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. As of 2019[update], Pence has cast 13 tie-breaking votes, seventh-most in history and more than his previous four predecessors (Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, Al Gore and Dan Quayle) cast combined (Cheney broke eight ties, Gore broke four ties, and Quayle and Biden did not cast a tie-breaking vote).\nIn April, Pence made a tour of the Asia-Pacific region. In South Korea, he met acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn and condemned North Korea's latest missile launch.[204][205][205][206] In Japan, Pence met Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe and pledged to work with Japan, South Korea, and China \"to achieve a peaceable resolution and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\" adding \"The era of strategic patience is over and while all options are on the table\".[207][208] Pence subsequently traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, where he met with president Joko Widodo, toured the largest mosque in the region (the Istiqlal Mosque), and praised moderate Islam.[209][210] Pence ended his trip with stops in Sydney, Australia (where, after meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, he said the U.S. \"intends to honor\" a U.S.\u2013Australia refugee resettlement agreement),[211] and Oahu, Hawaii and American Samoa.[212]\nOn May 21, 2017, Pence delivered the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame. Traditionally, the president delivers the address at Notre Dame in his inaugural year, but in 2017 Pence was invited instead when Trump decided to speak at Liberty University.[213][214][215][216]\nOn October 8, 2017, Pence walked out of a game between the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers at Trump's request after members of the 49ers knelt during the national anthem. Shortly afterwards, Pence commented via Twitter, \"President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem\"; further adding, \"While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I don't think its too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag and our national anthem.\"[217] Pence was widely criticized by various people for what was considered a publicity stunt. Democratic representative Adam Schiff (CA-28) questioned how much taxpayer's money was used to fund Pence's actions,[218] and it was later estimated that the cost of it all was about $242,500.[219] 49ers safety Eric Reid (the second NFL player after Colin Kaepernick to participate in the protests) told reporters it was predictable that Pence would walk out, knowing that most of the team were protesting.[218] Reid also expressed doubt over the regularity Pence is in terms of attending Colts matches, and referenced a photograph of the vice president and his wife in Colts uniform that had been tweeted before the match,[218] although the official photograph (right) proved otherwise. The photograph in question was first published in 2014.[220] Sportswriter Peter King wrote that the furor surrounding Pence had overshadowed Peyton Manning, who was being honored by the Colts, saying, \"Pence trumped a day that belonged to the greatest football hero the state of Indiana has ever seen, and he did it for political purposes\u00a0... he stole Manning's last great day as a Colt. [He] will have to live with himself for that.\"[218] The following year, Pence reacted positively on Twitter, after NFL owners unanimously decided to approve a new policy requiring all players to stand (or, given the option to stay in the locker room) during the national anthem, despite not consulting the NFL Players' Association.[221]\nOn February 1, 2018, it was announced that Pence would lead the presidential delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, alongside his wife.[222] Much of Pence's time at PyeongChang was affected by the ongoing North Korean crisis. Prior to the opening ceremony, on February 9, Pence skipped on a dinner held by South Korean president Moon Jae-in, as he would have shared a table with North Korea's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam.[223] Instead, he met with four North Korean defectors in Pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, Fred Warmbier (the father of Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in North Korea for attempted theft, and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, before returning to the U.S. in a comatose state).[224][225][226] At the ceremony, the Pences were seated in front of the North Korean delegates, and when North and South Korean athletes entered during the Parade of Athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse Pence of hypocrisy in regards to the NFL protests.[227][228] Pence was supposed to meet with the North Koreans on February 10, but they pulled out at the last minute.[229]\nOver the next few months, the North Koreans started communicating more with their neighbors, as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un secretly met with Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping in March and then Moon Jae-in in an historic inter-Korean summit in April,[230][231] and around the same time, a meeting between Trump and Kim was also proposed. On May 10, Pence accompanied Trump to Andrews Air Force Base as three American citizens were released by North Korea, and in an early morning interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl, he said seeing the men back on American soil \"was really one of the greatest joys of my life.\"[232][233] Talks broke down later that month following comments made by Pence and Trump, comparing the situation to events in Libya seven years previous, despite their voluntary disarmament of nuclear weapons in 2003.[234] North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence's remarks \"ignorant and stupid\".[235] On May 24, Trump abruptly called off the summit with Pence in attendance,[234] only for him to change his mind a day later,[236] later announcing that it would still be scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore.[237]\nIn May 2017, Pence filed FEC paperwork to form Great America Committee, a PAC that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst.[238][239] This is the only time a vice president has started his own PAC while still in office.[240] Pence denied a New York Times article's allegations that he will run for president in 2020, calling them \"laughable and absurd\", and said the article was \"disgraceful and offensive\".[241]\nPence is a key player in the Trump-Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry. After the inquiry was opened, Pence publicly stated his support of Trump's call for foreign investigation into 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden, saying, \"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.\"[242] House committees have requested information from Biden regarding the executive branch's dealings with Ukraine. Pence has had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Pence told the press that he did not mention Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption.[243]\nPence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate Iran's General Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Queda attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani, \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans.\" Pence insisted Soleimani, \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States,\" which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers, who actually numbered 19, and insinuating without evidence, that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated.[244] Pence's spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, 10 of whom \"were assisted by Soleimani\".[245]\nIn June 2019, the Democratic former New York City Council President Andrew Stein opined that Trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing Pence as his running mate with former South Carolina Governor and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.[246] Despite that, Trump has said Pence will be his running mate, but declined to endorse Pence in 2019 should his running mate seek to succeed him, but said he would give it \"very strong consideration\".[247]\nPence is described as being staunchly conservative on fiscal and social issues, with his political views strongly shaped by his Christian faith and by the conservative political theorist Russell Kirk.[1] During his acceptance speech for the nomination of Republican vice presidential candidate at the 2016 Republican National Convention he said, \"I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[248] As one commentator put it, \"Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve\u2014he wears the entire Jesus jersey.\"[16]\nPence is an opponent of abortion, and his unwavering support of abortion restrictions has gained him the support of grassroots conservative activists.[249] He began seeking to defund Planned Parenthood in 2007[250] and in three congressional sessions, he introduced legislation to block organizations that provide abortion services from receiving any Title X funding, even for services not related to reproductive health or family planning.[251]\nPence has criticized comprehensive sex education. In 2002, he criticized a speech by then-secretary of state Colin Powell, who had said it was \"important for young people\u00a0... to protect themselves from the possibility of acquiring any sexually transmitted disease\" through the use of condoms.[252][253] Pence called Powell's comments a \"sad day\" and expressed his support for abstinence education.[252][253] He asserted that \"condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases\" and that Powell was \"maybe inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives\".[252][253]\nPence opposed President Obama's executive order eliminating restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research, saying, \"I believe it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research\u00a0... I believe it is morally wrong to take the tax dollars of millions of pro-life Americans.\"[254][255] He asserted that \"scientific breakthroughs have rendered embryonic stem-cell research obsolete\".[254][255]\nOn January 27, 2017, Pence spoke at the March for Life in Washington D.C., becoming the first vice president and the highest-ranking United States official to ever speak at the annual event.[256][257]\nPence has said he supports an overturn of Roe v. Wade, though denying that Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for that purpose.[258][259]\nPence has been a vocal opponent of efforts to expand LGBT civil rights, during both his governorship and his tenure as a U.S. representative. In 2000 he said, \"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a 'discrete and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\"[260] Pence's 2000 congressional campaign website included text that called for \"an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus\" and instead advocated for resources to be directed toward institutions \"which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior\".[261][262][263][264] Pence has also been accused by LGBT rights advocates of endorsing conversion therapy, a charge he denies.[265]\nIn 2007, Pence voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have banned workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[266] Pence opposed the 2009 Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act,[267] saying that Barack Obama wanted to \"advance a radical social agenda\"[268] and said that pastors \"could be charged or be subject to intimidation for simply expressing a Biblical worldview on the issue of homosexual behavior\".[269]\nPence has said that homosexuals should not serve in the military, saying, \"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service because the presence of homosexuals in the ranks weakens unit cohesion.\"[270] Pence opposed the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" saying in 2010 that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military would \"have an impact on unit cohesion\".[270][271]\nPence opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[272] While in the House, he said that \"societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family\".[273] He has advocated a constitutional same-sex marriage ban but did not champion such a proposed ban for his first year as governor.[274]\nSince entering politics, Pence has been widely condemned for his opposition to LGBT rights, by politicians, celebrities, and academics, who have accused Pence of promoting and encouraging homophobia and transphobia. Rolling Stone published an article in 2016 assailing Pence for his anti-LGBT and other actions as governor, and a book by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner condemned Pence as a \"Christian supremacist.\"[275][276] Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBT rights organization, has frequently censured Pence over his views on rights for the LGBT community, delivering a report in April 2018 that heavily excoriated Pence for his \"homophobic\" history.[277] Among the protests against Donald Trump, protesters have also targeted Pence; in May 2017, students at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, walked out of classes on the day of a speech delivered at the university by Pence, to protest Pence's anti-LGBT rhetoric.[278] In March 2018, Jill Twiss, a writer for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver wrote with Oliver a children's book about Pence's pet rabbit Marlon Bundo; the book's pro-LGBT themes and support of same-sex marriage were praised by LGBT rights groups and reviewers on Amazon, becoming a bestseller after it was published; the book aimed to disparage Pence for his anti-LGBT rhetoric, and spoofed Charlotte Pence's children's book about the rabbit following her father around on a day as vice president, Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President.[279][280] Pence's daughter Charlotte expressed her support for the parody book and the charities both books benefitted.[281]\nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, openly gay figure skater Adam Rippon declined an invitation to a meeting with Pence in Pyeongchang, citing Pence's anti-LGBT history and alleged support for conversion therapy.[282] When Pence was made aware of Rippon's statement, he published a response on Twitter calling the charge of supporting conversion therapy \"fake news.\"[283] John Oliver berated Pence for his hostility towards LGBT citizens and accused him of lying in his denials of supporting conversion therapy by pointing out Pence's longtime friendship with evangelist and anti-LGBT activist James Dobson, who promoted conversion therapy.[284] Following the tweet, the New York Times brought attention to a statement from Pence's campaign website in 2000: \"Resources should be directed towards those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\" The statement was interpreted as evidence of hypocrisy by Pence, which generated heavy criticism from the medical and LGBT community, though a Pence spokeswoman in January said the \"accusation is totally false\" citing that changing \u201csexual behavior\u201d referred to Pence\u2019s support of the Ryan White CARE Act which encourages safe sex practices to combat HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. [285][286] The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler has called the allegations that Pence supported conversion therapy as \"a dubious assumption\", while other media such as CNN promoted the allegations as truthful.[287]\nPence's legislative history regarding LGBT rights has also come under political criticism. South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay, described Pence in August 2018 as \"a social extremist.\"[288] In June 2018, Pence visited Philadelphia. Prior to his arrival in the city, openly gay lawmaker Brian Sims, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 182nd district, posted a message and accompanying photo on Facebook of himself giving the middle finger to Pence, with the caption beneath the photo containing a statement denouncing Pence and his views on LGBT rights.[289] The posting of the image quickly drew controversy; while progressive commentators and media outlets lauded Sims for the message, right-wing and conservative sources were critical of Sims and the post, accusing him of lacking basic respect for the vice president; Sims responded on Twitter to the negative press by individually mocking detractors of the post and accusing them of supporting Donald Trump's alleged sexual assaults of women (which came to light following the release of a recording of Trump making obscene comments about women in 2016), and the controversial separations of immigrant families at the southern border conducted under the Trump administration.[289] Pence faced other protests and opposition during his visit to Philadelphia.\nIn January 2019, Pence's wife, Second Lady Karen Pence announced that she would return to teaching at Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C. The announcement drew immediate controversy based on Immanuel Christian School's code of conduct, which included that the school would refuse admission to students who were involved in or who had tolerated \"sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity.\" After Second Lady Pence and the school were condemned by the media, Pence defended his wife, stating in an interview, \"To see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us.\" Pence was in turn condemned for the defense; on January 19, singer and LGBT activist Lady Gaga denounced the Pences and Immanuel Christian School at a concert in Las Vegas, stating that Pence believes \"it's acceptable that his wife works at a school that bans LGBTQ. You are wrong!\", among other related statements.[290][291][292]\nIn March 2019, former Vice President Joe Biden referred to Pence as \"a decent guy\" during a speech at the University of Nebraska Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska, a month before Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign. LGBT groups, progressive leaders and celebrities strongly criticized him, with actress and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon chastising Biden on Twitter, to which Biden responded by apologizing and criticizing Pence's stance on LGBT rights. Nixon later penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Pence \"insidious and dangerous\" for his actions on LGBT rights, also condemning Pence's actions against abortion as Governor of Indiana and accusing the Vice President of continuing to support conversion therapy, writing that \"It's easy to say nice things about Pence when you're not personally threatened by his agenda. If Biden were being directly attacked in the same way that our community is, I think he would see Pence from a very different vantage point.\"[293][294]\nPence was a co-sponsor of H.J.Res.73, a 2011 spending limit amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment would limit federal spending to \"the average annual revenue collected in the three prior years, adjusted in proportion to changes in population and inflation\".[295] In regards to adopting the gold standard, Pence said in 2011, \"the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nation's monetary affairs\".[296] Pence proposed legislation to end the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve (maximizing employment and stabilizing prices), requiring the Fed to just focus on price stability and not full employment.[297][298] He has been a proponent of a flat federal tax rate.[299] Pence opposed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) (the \"Wall Street bailout\") of 2008.[299] Pence also opposed the auto industry rescue package of 2008\u201309, which guided General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy.[300]\nIn 2007, Pence voted against raising the federal minimum wage to $7.25 (from $5.15) an hour over two years, saying it would \"hurt the working poor\".[81] While in the House, Pence voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (\"card check\").[82] He voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[301] He had publicly opposed the bill[302] denouncing it as a failure, and called for a federal spending freeze.[303] Nevertheless, several months after voting against the bill, Pence privately sought $6\u00a0million in stimulus funds for projects in his district,[304] and in 2010, hosted a job fair for stimulus-backed employers.[305] A Pence spokesperson said that \"once it became law, he had a responsibility to support local efforts to secure funding for projects that could benefit people in his district\".[304] Pence voted against the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[306]\nPence was a supporter of earmark reform. He voted against the $139.7\u00a0billion Transportation-Treasury spending bill in June 2006, and in favor of a series of amendments proposed that same month by Jeff Flake which would strip other members' earmarks from the federal budget.[307] On occasion, however, Pence secured earmarks for projects in his district.[307]\nPence voted against the act that created Medicare Part\u00a0D (a prescription drug benefit)[42] and against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[308] In June 2012, after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius, Pence likened the ruling to the September 11 terrorist attacks in a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference. He immediately apologized for making the statement.[309]\nIn 2001, Pence wrote an op-ed arguing against the tobacco settlement and tobacco regulation, saying they would create \"new government bureaucracies\" and encroach on private lives. He said that \"despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill\".[121][310] Pence asserted, \"two out of every three smokers does [sic] not die from a smoking related illness and nine out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer\", while acknowledging that \"smoking isn't good for you\" and people who smoke should quit.[121][310] In 2009, Pence voted against the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which allows the FDA to regulate tobacco products.[311] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pence's state of Indiana has one of the worst smoking problems in America.[254]\nPence was slow to support a needle exchange program in Indiana to combat an HIV outbreak related to needle-sharing among opioid drug users. While giving credit for the program's ultimate start, an AIDS research foundation director of public policy later deemed the outbreak \"entirely preventable\". The state's health commissioner defended Pence's speed at responding to the situation.[312]\nIn June 2006, Pence unveiled an immigration plan (which he described as \"No Amnesty Immigration reform\") that would include increased border security, followed by strict enforcement of laws against hiring illegal aliens, and a guest worker program. This guest worker program would have required participants to apply from their home country to government-approved job placement agencies that match workers with employers who cannot find Americans for the job.[313] The plan received support from conservatives such as Dick Armey,[314] but attracted criticism from other conservatives such as Richard Viguerie and paleoconservatives Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan, who, as described by The New York Times, collectively viewed Pence as lending \"his conservative prestige to a form of liberal amnesty\".[14][315]\nIn 2009, Pence opposed birthright citizenship (the legal principle set forth by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\"). He co-sponsored a bill that would have limited citizenship to children born to at least one parent who is a citizen, immigrants living permanently in the U.S. or non-citizens performing active service in the Armed Forces.[316]\nIn 2010, Pence voted against the DREAM Act, which would grant the undocumented children of illegal immigrants conditional non-immigrant status if they met certain requirements.[317] In 2010, Pence said Arizona S.B. 1070, which at the time of passage in 2010 was the nation's broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration legislation, was \"a good faith to try and restore order to their communities\".[318]\nPence supported President George W. Bush's unsuccessful 2005 proposal to partially privatize Social Security[319] by allowing workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in private investment accounts and reduce the increase in benefits for high-income participants.[320] Pence had previously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush's.[320]\nWhen asked in 2010 if he would be willing to make cuts to Social Security, Pence answered, \"I think everything has to be on the table.\"[320] When asked if he would raise the retirement age, he said, \"I'm an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu.\"[320]\nPence supported the Patriot Act on its passage in 2001,[321] and in 2005 called the act \"essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home\".[322] Pence was a sponsor of legislation in 2009 to extend three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act (the library records provision, the roving-wiretap provision, and the lone-wolf provision) for an additional ten years.[323]\nPence \"has been a longtime, aggressive advocate of trade deals\" between the U.S. and foreign countries.[324] Pence has been a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),[324] and during his tenure in the House, he voted for every free-trade agreement that came before him.[325] Pence voted in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); in favor of keeping the U.S. in the World Trade Organization; and in favor of permanent normal trade relations with China.[325] Pence also supported bilateral free-trade agreements with Colombia, South Korea, Panama, Peru, Oman, Chile and Singapore.[325] Pence's strong stance in favor of free trade sharply differs from the stance of his running mate Trump, who has condemned globalization and the liberalization of trade.[324][325]\nPence voted against the Trade and Globalization Act of 2007, which would have expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance to American workers adversely affected by globalization.[326] However, in 2014 Pence called for the \"swift adoption\" of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), urging Indiana's congressional delegation to support the trade deal.[324]\nPence supported the Iraq War Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq.[327] During the Iraq War, Pence opposed setting a public withdrawal date from Iraq. During an April 2007 visit to Baghdad, Pence and John McCain visited Shorja market, the site of a deadly attack in February 2007 which had claimed 61 lives. Pence and McCain described the visit as evidence that the security situation in Iraqi markets had improved.[328] The visit to the market took place under tight security, including helicopters overhead, and the New York Times reported that the visit gave a false indication of how secure the area was because of the extremely heavy security forces protecting McCain.[329] Pence chaired the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush's Iraq War troop surge of 2007. At the time, Pence said \"the surge is working\" and defended the initial decision to invade in 2003.[327]\nPence has opposed closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and trying the suspected terrorists in the United States.[330] As an alternative, Pence has said the \"enemy combatants\" should be tried in a military tribunal.[330]\nPence has stated his support of Israel and its right to attack facilities in Iran to prevent the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons, has defended the actions of Israel in its use of deadly force in enforcing the blockade of Gaza, and has referred to Israel as \"America's most cherished ally\".[331] He visited Israel in 2014 to express his support, and in 2016 signed into law a bill which would ban Indiana from having any commercial dealings with a company that boycotts Israel.[332] He opposes a Palestinian state.[333]\nPence criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama's alleged weak leadership, saying: \"When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts. That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership.\"[334]\nTwo weeks prior to the NATO intervention in Libya, Pence thanked the Obama administration and secretary of state Hillary Clinton for their efforts to isolate the Gaddafi regime.[335][336][337] Pence expressed support for \"a no-fly zone\" and said \"Gaddafi must go.\"[335][336][337]\nPence condemned the \"terrible savagery\" against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, saying \"The images of the violence and its victims have shocked the American people, and decent people all over the world\".[338]\nPence called on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to release Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in the post-coup purges in Turkey,[339] or face significant sanctions.[340] On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on two senior Turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of Brunson.[341][342] Erdo\u011fan said the U.S. behavior will force Turkey to look for new friends and allies.[343]\nOn July 26, 2018, Pence raised the Xinjiang re-education camps issue at Ministerial To Advance Religious Freedom.[344] He said that \"Sadly, as we speak as well, Beijing is holding hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of Uyghur Muslims in so-called 're-education camps', where they're forced to endure around-the-clock political indoctrination and to denounce their religious beliefs and their cultural identity as the goal.\"[345]\nPence \"does not accept the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of climate change.\"[346] In 2001, Pence wrote in an op-ed that \"global warming is a myth,\" saying that \"the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago\".[347][348] In 2006 and 2009, Pence expressed the view that it was unclear whether global warming was driven by human activity, and in 2009 he told political commentator Chris Matthews that there was a \"growing skepticism in the scientific community about global warming\".[349][350] In 2009, Pence led the Republican effort to defeat the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman-Markey), a Democratic-backed bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions (and therefore combat climate change) through a cap-and-trade system.[346] On September 27, 2016, however, Pence said \"there's no question\" that human activity affects both the climate and the environment.[351] Pence holds a lifetime rating of four percent from the League of Conservation Voters.[352] While in the House, Pence \"voted to eliminate funding for climate education programs and to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions\".[108] Pence also \"repeatedly voted against energy efficiency and renewable energy funding and rules\" and voted \"for several bills that supported fossil fuel development, including legislation promoting offshore drilling\".[108]\nPence has questioned proposals to decrease penalties for low-level marijuana offenses in Indiana, saying the state should focus on \"reducing crime, not reducing penalties\".[353] In 2013, Pence expressed concern that a then-pending bill to revise the state's criminal code was not tough enough on drug crimes, and successfully lobbied to limit the reduction in sentencing of marijuana offenses.[354]\nIn 2016, he signed into law a measure that would reinstate a ten-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for certain drug offenders.[355][356]\nDuring 2014, Pence sent a letter to United States Attorney General Eric Holder, saying Indiana would not comply with federal prison rape elimination standards because they were \"too expensive\". According to the Indiana Department of Corrections, it would cost the state $15\u201320\u00a0million annually to comply with the guidelines. Pence said a number of rape prevention measures had already been \"implemented\".[357]\n\nIn 2015, Pence signed Senate Bill 94 to lengthen the statute of limitations for rape\u2014continuing for five years after sufficient DNA evidence is uncovered, enough recorded evidence is brought forth or discovered, or the offender confesses to the crime.[358] Pence also signed Senate Bill\u00a08 to allow the death penalty for beheadings if the victim was alive at the time of the offense.[358]Pence has been an advocate of federal restrictions on online gambling. In 2006, he was one of 35 cosponsors of H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte\u2013Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,[359] and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[360]\nPence praised the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission when it was announced. Pence said:\nFreedom won today in the Supreme Court. Today's ruling in the Citizens United case takes us one step closer to the Founding Fathers' vision of free speech, a vision that is cherished by all Americans and one Congress has a responsibility to protect. If the freedom of speech means anything, it means protecting the right of private citizens to voice opposition or support for their elected representatives. The fact that the court overturned a 20-year precedent speaks volumes about the importance of this issue.[361]Pence described the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known as McCain\u2013Feingold, which regulates the financing of political campaigns, as \"oppressive restrictions on free speech\".[362]\nIn the late 1990s, Pence put forth support for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton due to lying about an affair Clinton had as president, but also further argued for the moral requirements of the office of the presidency. Pence wrote that an American president with \"bad moral habits\" can \"incinerate the planet\", thus nothing less than a president who represents \"all of our highest hopes and ideals and values\" could be accepted. Pence also brought up \"staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce\" mandating that \"America needs to be able to look to her First Family as role models\".[363][364]\nAfter becoming vice president, Pence remained mostly silent on allegations that President Trump had extramarital affairs before his presidency with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, but on one occasion called Daniels' allegations \"baseless\".[363][364]\nMike and Karen Pence have been married since 1985. The two met while he was in law school at Indiana University.[16] They have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.[365][366] During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses.[11][20] Pence's son, Michael, is a first lieutenant and training to be a pilot in the United States Marine Corps.[367][368] Pence has five siblings. His oldest brother, Greg, ran in 2018 to represent Indiana's 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike), and won.[369][370] Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother, Nancy, a widow with four grown children and two teenagers. On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother married Basil Coolidge Fritsch, a widower since 2001.[371][372]\nThe Pences have four pets: a cat, a dog, a rabbit, and a snake.[373] Their rabbit, named Marlon Bundo, was featured in two children's books, both released in March 2018. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was written by Jill Twiss and released on March 18, 2018.[374] Marlon Bundo's: A Day in the Life of the Vice President was written by Charlotte and released on March 19, 2018.[375]\nPence was raised in a Catholic family, served as an altar server, and attended parochial school.[4][376] He became a born-again Christian in college, while a member of a nondenominational Christian student group, and identified his first year\u2014and specifically \"a Christian music festival in Asbury, Kentucky, in the spring of 1978\"[377] referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky\u2014as the moment he made a \"commitment to Christ.\"[4][376] After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister.[376] Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church.[4][376] In 2013, Pence said his family was \"kind of looking for a church.\"[4] He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\" and as \"a born-again, evangelical Catholic.\"[4][376]\nWhen asked by Chris Matthews in 2009 if he believed in evolution, Pence said \"I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. How he did that, I'll ask him about some day.\"[254][349] In a 2002 statement on the floor of the House of Representatives (reported in the Congressional Record), Pence told his colleagues \"...\u00a0I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\"[378][379]\nPence adheres to the Billy Graham rule, in which husbands avoid spending time alone with women to whom they are not married.[380][381]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III; August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to his presidency, he served as governor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981 and 1983\u20131992) and as attorney general of Arkansas (1977\u20131979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and is one of only three U.S. presidents to have been impeached.[1] The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern. He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University,[2] University College, Oxford, and Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the Attorney General of Arkansas, serving from 1977 to 1979. He later served as governor of Arkansas. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. He passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and has continually received high scores in the historical rankings of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. In addition, he secured the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea, visiting the capital Pyongyang in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[3][4] He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[5] His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[6] Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[4] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[4][7][8][9][10] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[4] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[11] Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15[12] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[4] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr.; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.[4][13] In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[4] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[14] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".[15] Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[4][13] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[16] With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968. In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[17] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[4] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[18] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[19] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[20] Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[21] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[13][22][23] During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[21][24] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\".[21] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[25] While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[22][26] During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[27] While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[4] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[28] He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\".[29] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers\u00a01 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[30] Colonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[32] Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[33][34] Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[35] After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[4][13] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[4][36] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[37] The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[38] Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[39] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[40] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[41] Bill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[36] After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[42] Clinton was elected.[13] In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.[43] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\".[44][45][46] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31\u00a0percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[13] Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[47] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[48] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[49] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[49][50] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[13] In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history.[48] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[13][49] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[42] Also in the 1980s, The Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[51] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[13][52] According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[53][54] During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[55] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[56] In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities.[57] Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady).[58] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[59] and poorly delivered.[60] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[49][61] During his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[62][63] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[64][65] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[66][67][68] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\u00a0billion in 1998, $126\u00a0billion in 1999, and $236\u00a0billion in 2000,[69] during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[70] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[71][72] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[73] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York, in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York. In the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[13] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.[74] Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[13][61] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[61] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[13] During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[4][75] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[76] Clinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[53][77] Bush's approval ratings were around 80\u00a0percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[61] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40\u00a0percent.[61][78] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates were alienated.[79] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[80] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[81] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[81] Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.[81] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[5] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[82][83] Inaugural address, January 20, 1993.[84] Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[85] and was popular with the public.[86] Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[87] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[88] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[89] On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[90] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[91] Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[92] On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[93] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[94] In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15\u00a0million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90\u00a0percent of small businesses,[95] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\u00a0percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[96] On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[52] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[49][52] In November 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.[97] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair. On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[52] In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".[98] That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[99] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban\u00a0... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\".[100] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[101] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[49] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[102] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[103] On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[104] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[104] The Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[105] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[106] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period. [107] On October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[108][109] The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[110][111] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[112] After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[113] The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[114] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.[115] On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.[116] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[117] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[118] Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\".[119] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[118] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\"[120] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[121] Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[122] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[123] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[124] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[125] Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[126] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[127] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[123] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[128] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[129] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[130] Bill Clinton's announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[131] The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[132][133] Despite the evidence,[132][134] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[135] As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[136] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[137][138] Ken Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[139] According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\".[140] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[139] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[140] Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[140] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[141] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[142] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[142] The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[140] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[140] In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2\u00a0percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7\u00a0percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4\u00a0percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[143] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70\u00a0percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes. In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[144] In 1999 he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[145] Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228-206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury[146] and voted 221-212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.[147] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson) to be impeached.[148][149] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[150] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\",[151] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998. While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[152] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition. The Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[153] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly.[154] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[153] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[155] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[153] On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[156][157] Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[52][158] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[159] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.[160] During his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets\u2014a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.[161] In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was planned.[162] Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[163] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"[164] In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement. In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the UK government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRA's political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles.[165] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[166] In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8\u00a0million (equivalent to $214.86\u00a0million in 2019) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[167] Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).[168] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[169] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[170] In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[171] and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[172] To stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[173][174] of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[175] NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,[176] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[177] Opinions in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[178][179] Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing.[180][181] In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\".[182] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\".[183] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[184] Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the Kosovo war.[185] Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[185][186] In Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world\", and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[187] Seeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[188][189] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\"[190] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[191][192] Clinton's November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[193] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China.[194] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[195] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[196] Relations were damaged for a time by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[197] The U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton.[198][199][200] President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton.[201] U.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000.[202] Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated.[203][204] After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[52] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[4][205] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[52] Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[206] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[207] Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84\u00a0percent of his nominees were confirmed.[208] Sonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[209][210] Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[211] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[212] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[212] Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[213] Throughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[214] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[215] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[216] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[217] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[217] As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45\u00a0percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55\u00a0percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\u00a0percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\u00a0percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[217] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22\u00a0percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\".[217] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of a good job.\"[218] In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[219] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[220][221] In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[222] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[222] A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[223] As the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first chief executive since Calvin Coolidge who was not alive during World War II.[225] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[226][227] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\".[228] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[229] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[229] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[230] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88\u00a0m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fifth-tallest president in the nation's history.[231][232] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South.[233] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[234][235] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[236][237] Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[238] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[239] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure.[239] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large.[240] Clinton, a Baptist,[241] has been open about his faith.[242] Shortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clinton's past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency.[243] Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president.[243] Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein.[244] Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[245][246][247] In 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[248] Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[249] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[250] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[251] Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[252] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[253] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[254] In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[255] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[256] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[257] Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[258] Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[259] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.[260] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[259] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.[259] The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.[261] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[262] During the 2018 Congressional elections, no Democratic candidate for office asked Clinton to campaign with him or her, a change that The New York Times attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[261] Clinton boarded the Lolita Express, a private plane of registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, at least 26 times.[263][264] Flight records indicate that underage girls and young women, such as Chauntae Davies, who were told to do whatever Epstein asks, were present on the plane the majority of the times Clinton boarded the plane.[265][266][267] Epstein has claimed he co-founded the Clinton Foundation.[268] Clinton has denied knowing anything about the Lolita Express or about Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse, despite it being public record.[269][270] Bill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,[271] and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention.[272] In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[273][274] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[275] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[276] The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.[277] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life, in 2004.[278] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[279] In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[280] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[281] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[282] and traveled to the affected areas.[283] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[284] Based on his philanthropic worldview,[285] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[286] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[287] Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[288] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[289] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\u00a0percent in developing nations.[290] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[291] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\u00a0million toward her campaign.[292] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[293] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[294] Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[295] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[296] After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[297][298] In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[299] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[299] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[300][301] Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.[302] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\".[303] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[304] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[303] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[305][306] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[307] During the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina.[308] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[309] On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[310] In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[311] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[312] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[311][313] After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[314] The Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office.[315] Bill and Hillary Clinton have each received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[316] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240\u00a0million in the 15\u00a0years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[317] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153\u00a0million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[318] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25\u00a0million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5\u00a0million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[319] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5\u00a0million and $25.5\u00a0million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17\u00a0million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[320] Clinton earned more than $104\u00a0million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[321] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100\u00a0million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns[322] show they made $109\u00a0million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92\u00a0million from his speaking and book-writing.[316][323][324][325] Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[318][326][327][328] Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.[329][330] Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.\" She added, \"Bill has worked really hard\u00a0... we had to pay off all our debts\u00a0... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.\"[324] Various colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[331][332] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[333] He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[334][335] Schools have been named for Clinton,[336][337][338] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[339][340] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[341] Arkansas,[342] Kentucky,[343] and New York.[344] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[345] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001.[346] He has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[347] Papua New Guinea,[348] Germany,[349] and Kosovo.[339] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[350][351][352] Clinton was selected as Time's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992,[353] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[354] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[355] He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[356] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[357] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[358] In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise\".[359] U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[360] Bill Clinton is one of the narrators on a 2003 recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, on Pentatone, together with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren.

Prior to his presidency, he served as governor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981 and 1983\u20131992) and as attorney general of Arkansas (1977\u20131979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and is one of only three U.S. presidents to have been impeached.[1] The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern. He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office.\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University,[2] University College, Oxford, and Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the Attorney General of Arkansas, serving from 1977 to 1979. He later served as governor of Arkansas. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history.\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. He passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\nClinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and has continually received high scores in the historical rankings of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. In addition, he secured the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea, visiting the capital Pyongyang in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.\nClinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[3][4] He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[5] His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[6] Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[4] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[4][7][8][9][10] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[4] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[11]\nAlthough he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15[12] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[4] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr.; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.[4][13]\n\nIn Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[4] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[14] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".[15]\nClinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[4][13] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[16]\nWith the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968.\nIn 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[17] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[4] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[18] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[19] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[20]\nUpon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[21] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[13][22][23]\nDuring his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[21][24] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\".[21] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[25]\nWhile Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[22][26]\nDuring the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[27] While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[4] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[28]\nHe subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\".[29] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers\u00a01 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[30]\nColonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[32] Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[33][34] Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[35]\nAfter Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[4][13] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[4][36] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[37] The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[38]\nClinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[39] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[40] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[41]\nBill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[36]\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[42] Clinton was elected.[13]\nIn 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.[43] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\".[44][45][46] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31\u00a0percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[13]\nClinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[47] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[48] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[49] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[49][50] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[13]\nIn the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history.[48] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[13][49] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[42]\nAlso in the 1980s, The Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[51] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[13][52]\nAccording to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[53][54] During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[55] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[56]\nIn 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities.[57] Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady).[58] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[59] and poorly delivered.[60] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[49][61]\nDuring his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[62][63] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[64][65] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[66][67][68] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\u00a0billion in 1998, $126\u00a0billion in 1999, and $236\u00a0billion in 2000,[69] during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[70] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[71][72] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[73] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York, in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.\nIn the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[13] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.[74]\nWinning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[13][61] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[61] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[13]\nDuring the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[4][75] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[76]\nClinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[53][77]\nBush's approval ratings were around 80\u00a0percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[61] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40\u00a0percent.[61][78] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates were alienated.[79] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[80] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[81] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[81]\nClinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.[81] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[5] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[82][83]\nInaugural address, January 20, 1993.[84]\nClinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[85] and was popular with the public.[86]\nTwo days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[87] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[88] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[89]\nOn February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[90] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[91] Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[92]\nOn May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[93] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[94]\nIn August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15\u00a0million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90\u00a0percent of small businesses,[95] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\u00a0percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[96]\nOn September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[52] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[49][52]\nIn November 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.[97] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.\nOn November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[52]\nIn December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".[98]\nThat month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[99] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban\u00a0... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\".[100] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[101] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[49] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[102] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[103]\nOn January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[104] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[104]\nThe Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[105] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[106] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period. [107]\nOn October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[108][109] The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[110][111] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[112]\nAfter two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[113]\nThe White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[114] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.[115]\nOn September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.[116] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[117] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[118] Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\".[119] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[118] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\"[120] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[121]\nDespite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[122] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[123] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[124] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[125] Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[126] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[127] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[123] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[128] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[129] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[130]\nBill Clinton's announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[131]\nThe 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[132][133] Despite the evidence,[132][134] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[135]\nAs part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[136] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[137][138]\nKen Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[139] According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\".[140] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[139] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[140] Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[140] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[141] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[142] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[142] The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[140] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[140]\nIn the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2\u00a0percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7\u00a0percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4\u00a0percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[143] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70\u00a0percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.\nIn the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[144] In 1999 he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[145]\nClinton was impeached on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228-206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury[146] and voted 221-212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.[147] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson) to be impeached.[148][149] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[150] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\",[151] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.\nWhile the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[152] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.\nThe Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[153] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly.[154] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[153] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[155] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[153]\nOn January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[156][157]\nClinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[52][158] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[159] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.[160]\nDuring his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions.\nThe Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets\u2014a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.[161] In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.\nIn April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was planned.[162] Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[163] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"[164]\nIn 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.\nIn 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the UK government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRA's political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles.[165] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[166]\nIn February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8\u00a0million (equivalent to $214.86\u00a0million in 2019) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[167]\nCapturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).[168] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[169] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[170]\nIn response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[171] and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[172]\nTo stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[173][174] of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[175] NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,[176] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[177] Opinions in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[178][179] Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing.[180][181] In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\".[182] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\".[183] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[184] Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the Kosovo war.[185] Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[185][186]\n\nIn Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world\", and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[187]\nSeeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[188][189] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\"[190] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[191][192]\nClinton's November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[193] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China.[194] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[195] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[196]\nRelations were damaged for a time by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[197]\nThe U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton.[198][199][200] President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton.[201]\nU.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000.[202] Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated.[203][204]\nAfter initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[52] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[4][205] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[52]\nClinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[206] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[207]\nAlong with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84\u00a0percent of his nominees were confirmed.[208]\nSonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[209][210]\nClinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[211] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[212] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[212] Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[213]\nThroughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[214] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[215] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[216] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[217] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[217]\nAs he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45\u00a0percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55\u00a0percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\u00a0percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\u00a0percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[217] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22\u00a0percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\".[217] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of a good job.\"[218]\nIn May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[219] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[220][221]\nIn 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[222] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[222]\nA 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[223]\nAs the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first chief executive since Calvin Coolidge who was not alive during World War II.[225] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[226][227] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\".[228] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[229] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[229] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[230] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88\u00a0m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fifth-tallest president in the nation's history.[231][232] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South.[233] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[234][235] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[236][237]\nClinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[238] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[239] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure.[239] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large.[240] Clinton, a Baptist,[241] has been open about his faith.[242]\nShortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clinton's past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency.[243] Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president.[243] Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein.[244]\nSeveral women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[245][246][247]\nIn 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[248] Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[249] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[250] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[251] Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[252] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[253] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[254]\nIn 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[255] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[256] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[257] Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[258]\nAlso in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[259] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.[260] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[259] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.[259]\nThe Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.[261] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[262] During the 2018 Congressional elections, no Democratic candidate for office asked Clinton to campaign with him or her, a change that The New York Times attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[261]\nClinton boarded the Lolita Express, a private plane of registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, at least 26 times.[263][264] Flight records indicate that underage girls and young women, such as Chauntae Davies, who were told to do whatever Epstein asks, were present on the plane the majority of the times Clinton boarded the plane.[265][266][267] Epstein has claimed he co-founded the Clinton Foundation.[268] Clinton has denied knowing anything about the Lolita Express or about Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse, despite it being public record.[269][270]\nBill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,[271] and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention.[272]\nIn 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[273][274] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[275] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[276]\nThe William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.[277] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life, in 2004.[278] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[279]\nIn the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[280] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[281] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[282] and traveled to the affected areas.[283] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[284]\nBased on his philanthropic worldview,[285] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[286] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[287] Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[288] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[289] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\u00a0percent in developing nations.[290] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[291]\nDuring the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\u00a0million toward her campaign.[292] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[293] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[294] Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[295] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[296] After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[297][298]\nIn 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[299] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[299] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[300][301]\nSince then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.[302] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\".[303] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[304] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[303] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[305][306] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[307]\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina.[308] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[309]\nOn September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[310]\nIn September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[311] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[312] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[311][313] After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[314]\nThe Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office.[315] Bill and Hillary Clinton have each received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[316] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240\u00a0million in the 15\u00a0years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[317] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153\u00a0million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[318] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25\u00a0million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5\u00a0million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[319] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5\u00a0million and $25.5\u00a0million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17\u00a0million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[320] Clinton earned more than $104\u00a0million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[321] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100\u00a0million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns[322] show they made $109\u00a0million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92\u00a0million from his speaking and book-writing.[316][323][324][325]\nBill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[318][326][327][328] Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.[329][330] Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.\" She added, \"Bill has worked really hard\u00a0... we had to pay off all our debts\u00a0... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.\"[324]\nVarious colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[331][332] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[333] He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[334][335] Schools have been named for Clinton,[336][337][338] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[339][340] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[341] Arkansas,[342] Kentucky,[343] and New York.[344] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[345] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001.[346]\nHe has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[347] Papua New Guinea,[348] Germany,[349] and Kosovo.[339] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[350][351][352]\nClinton was selected as Time's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992,[353] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[354] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[355] He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[356] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[357] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[358]\nIn 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise\".[359]\nU.S. President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[360]\nBill Clinton is one of the narrators on a 2003 recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, on Pentatone, together with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren.\nOrganizations\n</body></html>"

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He represented the 13th district for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. He received national attention in 2004 with his March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his campaign began, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Regarded as a centrist New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\u2013Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki. After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.[2] Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in Washington, D.C.[3][4] A December 2019 Gallup poll found that Obama was the most admired man in America for a record 12th consecutive year.[5] Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[6] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[7][8][9] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[10] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942\u20131995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[12] His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936\u20131982),[13] was a married[14][15][16] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[14][17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[18][19] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[20][21] In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[22] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[23] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[24] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[25] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me\u2014that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk\u2014barely registered in my mind.\"[19] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[26] In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East\u2013West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[27] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet sub district of south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng sub district of central Jakarta.[28] Obama started in St. Francis Pre-Education from age three to five. From age six to ten, he then attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[29][30] As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.[31][32][33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"[34] In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School\u2014a private college preparatory school\u2014with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[35] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"[36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[39] Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered\u2014to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect\u2014became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"[40] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"[41] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang,\" a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[42][43] After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[44] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[45] and in English literature[46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[47] He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[48][49] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[50][51][52] In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.\"[53] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family\u2014six of them living.[54] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[55] until her death on November 2, 2008,[56] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[57] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.[58][59][60] Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[61] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[62] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.[63] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[64] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,[65] and he is left-handed.[66] Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[67] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[67][68] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[68] In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[69] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[70] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[71] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children.[72] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[73] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.[74] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[75] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[76] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[77] In 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6\u00a0million house (equivalent to $2.1\u00a0million in 2019) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[78] The purchase of an adjacent lot\u2014and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko\u2014attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[79] In December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3\u00a0million (equivalent to $1.6\u00a0million in 2019) .[80] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5\u00a0million\u2014up from about $4.2\u00a0million in 2007 and $1.6\u00a0million in 2005\u2014mostly from sales of his books.[81][82] On his 2010 income of $1.7\u00a0million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[83][84] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10\u00a0million.[85] In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.[86][87] On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a feminist.[88][89][90] Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[91] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person\u00a0... I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"[92] In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"[93] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't\u2014frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead\u2014being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.\"[94][95] Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[96] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright's statements were criticized.[97] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.[98][99][100] Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[51][101] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[102] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[103] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[104][105] Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[107] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[108] president of the journal in his second year,[102][109] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.[110] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[111] After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude[112] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[108] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[102][109] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[113] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[113] In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[113][114] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[115] From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.[116] He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).[117] This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.[118] The case was settled out of court.[119] Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.[120] His law license became inactive in 2007.[121][122] From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago\u2014which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project\u2014and of the Joyce Foundation.[51] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[51] Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park\u2013Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[123] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[124][125] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[126] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[127][128] He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[129][130] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[131] In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[132] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[126][133][134][135] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[136] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[137] In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[138] Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[139] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[140] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[141] and spoke out against the war.[142] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.[143] Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.[144] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide\u2014which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[145] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[146] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[147] Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[148] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[149] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.[150] Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[151] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[152] CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[153] Obama cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[154] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar\u2013Obama, which expanded the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[155] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[156] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama\u2014along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain\u2014introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[157] Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.[158] Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.[159] In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[161][162] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.[163][164] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,[165][166] and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.[167] Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.[168] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.[169] He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;[170] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.[171] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.[172] Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.[173] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.[174] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs.[175] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.[176] On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[177][178] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.[177][179] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system,[180] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.[181] Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[182] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[183] On August 23, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[184] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.[184] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[185] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38\u00a0million people worldwide.[186][187][188] During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[189] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[190] John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate. The two candidates engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.[191] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.[192] Obama won 52.9% of the popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.[193] He became the first African American to be elected president.[194] Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.[195] On April 4, 2011, Obama announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission.[196][197][198] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries,[199] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.[200] At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.[201] On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.[202][203][204] With 51.1% of the popular vote,[205] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice.[206][207] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"[208][209] The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[210] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[211] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[212][213][214] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.[215] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[216] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[217] The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.[218] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4\u00a0million uninsured children.[219] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.[220] Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[221] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent.[222] Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.[223] On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[224][225] In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[226] President Obama's 2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on \"clean\" electricity.[227][228] On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[229] On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV, which was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[230] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[231][232] to end the Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.[233] In 2016, the Pentagon also ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.[234] As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[235] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.[236] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"[237] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[238][239] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[209] Obama became the first U.S. President in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law\u2014for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.[240][241] In 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[242] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[243] Then, following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\"[244] On July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the Human Rights Campaign.[245] On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.[246] The Council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett.[247] Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.[247][248][249] The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett.[248] The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.[250] On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787\u00a0billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[252] In March, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public\u2013Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two\u00a0trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.[253] Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[254] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[255] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.[256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[257] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers,\" which temporarily boosted the economy.[258][259][260] The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5\u00a0trillion, but only $3\u00a0trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.[261] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5\u00a0trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4\u00a0trillion or 9.9% of GDP.[262][263] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34\u00a0trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53\u00a0trillion or 90% of GDP.[264] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2\u00a0trillion took effect in February 2014.[265] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5\u00a0trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2\u00a0trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[266] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[267] As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[270] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[271] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,[272] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.[273] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.[274] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.[275] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[275] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain.\"[276] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.[277] The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[278][279] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1\u20132.1\u00a0million,[279][280][281][282] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"[278] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[283] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[284] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the US and the austerity measures in the European Union.[285] Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[286] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858\u00a0billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[287] In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[288] Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[289] On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.[290][291] On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[292] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[293] In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions.\"[294][295] Obama's advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.[296] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.[297] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.[298] Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000\u00a0ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[299][300][301][302] Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[303] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900\u00a0billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[304][305] On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[303] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[307] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[308] On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[309][310] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill\u2014without a public option\u2014on a party-line vote of 60\u201339.[311] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[312] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[313] The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133%\u00a0of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[314] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400%\u00a0of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,[315][316] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[315][317] The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[319] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[320] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143\u00a0billion over the first decade.[321] The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5\u20134 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.[322] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6\u20133 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State,\" as the statute reads.[323] Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[324] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.[325][326] On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[327] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[328] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[329] In a 2016 editorial in the New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.[330] Obama called the November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[331] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking.\"[332] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[333] On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[334][335] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636, \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\"[336] In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.[337][338][339] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.[339] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.[340] Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,[338] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.[341][342] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however.[343] In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[344] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya.[345] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[346][347] In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[348] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[349] On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"[350] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"[351] On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.[352] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[353][354] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[355] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[356] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[357] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,[358] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[359] In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between Cuba and the United States.[360] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015. In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.[361][362] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.[363] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.[364] Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president.[365] On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"[366] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[367][368] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[369] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"[370] In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[371][372] In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.[373] By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[374] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[375] In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,[376] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[377] Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.[378] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,\" an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"[379] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[380] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[381] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[382] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[383] In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[384] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[385] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[386] In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"[387] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[388] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[389] In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"[390] In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"[391] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[392] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"[393] On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.[394] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions,[395][396] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.[397] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342\u201380 to condemn the UN Resolution.[398][399] In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[400] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[401] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi\u2014who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi[402]\u2014announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[403] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[404] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[405][406][407] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[408] Some Representatives[409] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[410][411] On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\"[412][413] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[414] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[415] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[416][417] In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged[418] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[419][420] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.[421][422] Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56\u00a0km) from Islamabad.[423] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[423] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[423] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[424][425] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[426] which was buried at sea several hours later.[427] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[424][428] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.[429] In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[430][431][432] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"[433] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.[434][435] Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.[436] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.[437] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[438] In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of d\u00e9tente.[439] Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"[440] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana.[441] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[442] Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[443] Obama spoke in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.[444][445] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.[446] On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.[447] After Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[448] Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.[449] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West,\" adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[450] Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[451] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"[452] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"[453] Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[454] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[455] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,[456][457] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.[458] According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating[459] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,[460] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[461] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[462][463] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.[464] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.[465] Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[466][467] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[468] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[469][470] Obama won Best Spoken Word Album Grammy Awards for abridged audiobook versions of Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.[471] His concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \"Yes We Can,\" which was viewed 10\u00a0million times on YouTube in its first month[472] and received a Daytime Emmy Award.[473] In December 2008 and in 2012, Time magazine named Obama as its Person of the Year.[474] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.\"[475] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following Charles de Gaulle in 1960, Nelson Mandela in 1996, Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.[476][477] On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"[478] Obama accepted this award in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"[479] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[480][481][482][483] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by The New York Times.[484] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[485] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect.[486] Obama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the inauguration of his Republican successor, Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to Joint Base Andrews.[487] The family currently rents a house in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.[488] On March 2, 2017, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"[489] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.[490] On May 4, three days ahead of the French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed Emmanuel Macron: \"He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France.\"[491] Macron went on to win the election. While in Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.[492] Obama traveled to Kensington Palace in England and met with Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.[493] After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: \"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\"[494] After Senate Republicans revealed the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, on June 22, Obama released a Facebook post calling the bill \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\"[495] On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing \"a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.\"[496] After Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision.[497] Two days later, he partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[498] Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation in Chicago on October 31. Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.[499] Obama has also been working on a Presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with Penguin Random House.[500] Obama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China, India and France. In China, he delivered remarks at the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.[501][502] He then went to India, where he spoke at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit before meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi over lunch. In addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the Obama Foundation.[503][504] He also met with the Dalai Lama while in New Delhi.[505] He ended his five-day trip in France where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, former President Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.[506] Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas\u2019 newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"[507][508] Higher Ground's first film, American Factory, was nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar in 2020.[509] A package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Obama's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service during routine mail screenings. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of Donald Trump and to CNN. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. On October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in Manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.[510][511] In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha's Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck.[512][513] Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal,\" have thus far failed.[514] Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[515][516][517][518] Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.[514] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3\u00a0million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term.[519] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[520] In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity. As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[521] In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.[522] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[523][234] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68% of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.[524] Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.[525][526] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the US dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[527][528] Obama left about 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[529][530] According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[531] Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.[532][533] A 2018 survey of historians by the American Political Science Association ranked Obama the 8th-greatest American President.[4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked Obama the 18th-greatest American President.[534] The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library. It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago.[535]",

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He represented the 13th district for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. He received national attention in 2004 with his March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his campaign began, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\nRegarded as a centrist New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\u2013Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki.\nAfter winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.[2]\nObama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in Washington, D.C.[3][4] A December 2019 Gallup poll found that Obama was the most admired man in America for a record 12th consecutive year.[5]\nObama was born on August 4, 1961,[6] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[7][8][9] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[10] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942\u20131995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[12] His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936\u20131982),[13] was a married[14][15][16] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[14][17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[18][19] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[20][21]\nIn late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[22] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[23] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[24] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[25] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me\u2014that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk\u2014barely registered in my mind.\"[19] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[26]\nIn 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East\u2013West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[27] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet sub district of south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng sub district of central Jakarta.[28]\nObama started in St. Francis Pre-Education from age three to five. From age six to ten, he then attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[29][30] As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.[31][32][33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"[34]\nIn 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School\u2014a private college preparatory school\u2014with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[35] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"[36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[39]\nObama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered\u2014to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect\u2014became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"[40] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"[41] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang,\" a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[42][43]\nAfter graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[44] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[45] and in English literature[46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[47] He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[48][49] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[50][51][52]\nIn a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.\"[53] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family\u2014six of them living.[54] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[55] until her death on November 2, 2008,[56] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[57] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.[58][59][60]\nObama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[61] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[62] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.[63] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[64] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,[65] and he is left-handed.[66]\nObama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[67] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[67][68] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[68]\nIn June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[69] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[70] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[71] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children.[72] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[73] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.[74] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[75] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[76] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[77]\nIn 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6\u00a0million house (equivalent to $2.1\u00a0million in 2019) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[78] The purchase of an adjacent lot\u2014and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko\u2014attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[79]\nIn December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3\u00a0million (equivalent to $1.6\u00a0million in 2019) .[80] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5\u00a0million\u2014up from about $4.2\u00a0million in 2007 and $1.6\u00a0million in 2005\u2014mostly from sales of his books.[81][82] On his 2010 income of $1.7\u00a0million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[83][84] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10\u00a0million.[85]\nIn early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.[86][87]\nOn his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a feminist.[88][89][90]\nObama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[91] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person\u00a0... I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"[92]\nIn January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"[93] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't\u2014frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead\u2014being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.\"[94][95]\nObama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[96] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright's statements were criticized.[97] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.[98][99][100]\nTwo years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[51][101] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[102] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[103] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[104][105]\nDespite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[107] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[108] president of the journal in his second year,[102][109] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.[110] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins &amp; Sutter in 1990.[111] After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude[112] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[108] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[102][109] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[113] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[113]\nIn 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[113][114] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[115]\nFrom April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.[116]\nHe joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).[117] This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.[118] The case was settled out of court.[119] Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.[120] His law license became inactive in 2007.[121][122]\nFrom 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago\u2014which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project\u2014and of the Joyce Foundation.[51] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[51]\nObama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park\u2013Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[123] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[124][125] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[126] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[127][128]\nHe was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[129][130] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[131]\nIn January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[132] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[126][133][134][135] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[136] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[137]\nIn May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[138]\nObama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[139] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[140] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[141] and spoke out against the war.[142] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.[143]\nDecisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.[144] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide\u2014which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[145] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[146] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[147]\nObama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[148] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[149] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.[150]\nObama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[151] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[152] CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[153]\nObama cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[154] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar\u2013Obama, which expanded the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[155] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[156] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama\u2014along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain\u2014introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[157]\nObama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.[158] Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.[159]\nIn December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[161][162] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.[163][164] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,[165][166] and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.[167]\nLater in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.[168] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.[169] He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;[170] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.[171] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.[172]\nObama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.[173] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.[174] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs.[175] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.[176]\nOn February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[177][178] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.[177][179] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system,[180] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.[181]\nNumerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[182] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[183]\nOn August 23, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[184] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.[184] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[185] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38\u00a0million people worldwide.[186][187][188]\nDuring both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[189] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[190]\nJohn McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate. The two candidates engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.[191] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.[192] Obama won 52.9% of the popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.[193] He became the first African American to be elected president.[194] Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.[195]\nOn April 4, 2011, Obama announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission.[196][197][198] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries,[199] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.[200]\nAt the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.[201]\nOn November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.[202][203][204] With 51.1% of the popular vote,[205] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice.[206][207] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"[208][209]\nThe inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[210] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[211] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[212][213][214] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.[215] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[216] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[217]\nThe first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.[218] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4\u00a0million uninsured children.[219] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.[220]\nObama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[221] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent.[222] Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.[223]\nOn March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[224][225]\nIn a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[226]\nPresident Obama's 2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on \"clean\" electricity.[227][228]\nOn October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[229]\nOn October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV, which was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[230]\nOn December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[231][232] to end the Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.[233] In 2016, the Pentagon also ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.[234]\nAs a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[235] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.[236] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"[237] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[238][239]\nDuring his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[209] Obama became the first U.S. President in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law\u2014for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.[240][241]\nIn 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[242] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[243] Then, following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\"[244]\nOn July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the Human Rights Campaign.[245]\nOn March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.[246] The Council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett.[247] Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.[247][248][249] The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett.[248] The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.[250]\nOn February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787\u00a0billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[252]\nIn March, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public\u2013Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two\u00a0trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.[253]\nObama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[254] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[255] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.[256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[257] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers,\" which temporarily boosted the economy.[258][259][260]\nThe Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5\u00a0trillion, but only $3\u00a0trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.[261] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5\u00a0trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4\u00a0trillion or 9.9% of GDP.[262][263] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34\u00a0trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53\u00a0trillion or 90% of GDP.[264] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2\u00a0trillion took effect in February 2014.[265] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5\u00a0trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2\u00a0trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[266] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[267]\nAs it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[270] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[271] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,[272] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.[273] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.[274] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.[275] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[275] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain.\"[276] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.[277]\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[278][279] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1\u20132.1\u00a0million,[279][280][281][282] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"[278] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[283] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[284] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the US and the austerity measures in the European Union.[285]\nWithin a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[286] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858\u00a0billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[287]\nIn December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[288]\nObama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[289]\nOn September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.[290][291]\nOn April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[292] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[293]\nIn July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions.\"[294][295] Obama's advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.[296] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.[297] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.[298]\nObama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000\u00a0ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[299][300][301][302]\nObama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[303] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900\u00a0billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[304][305]\nOn July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[303] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[307] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[308]\nOn November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[309][310] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill\u2014without a public option\u2014on a party-line vote of 60\u201339.[311] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[312] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[313]\nThe ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133%\u00a0of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[314] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400%\u00a0of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,[315][316] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[315][317]\nThe costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[319] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[320] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143\u00a0billion over the first decade.[321]\nThe law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5\u20134 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.[322] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6\u20133 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State,\" as the statute reads.[323]\nPrior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[324] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.[325][326]\nOn January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[327] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[328] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[329] In a 2016 editorial in the New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.[330]\nObama called the November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[331] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking.\"[332] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[333]\nOn November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[334][335] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636, \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\"[336]\nIn 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.[337][338][339] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.[339] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.[340] Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,[338] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.[341][342] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however.[343]\nIn February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[344] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya.[345]\nOn March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[346][347] In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[348] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[349]\nOn June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"[350] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"[351]\nOn September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.[352]\nIn March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[353][354] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[355] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[356]\nIn December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[357] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,[358] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[359]\nIn December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between Cuba and the United States.[360] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.\nIn March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.[361][362] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.[363] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.[364]\nBefore leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president.[365]\nOn February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"[366] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[367][368] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[369] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"[370]\nIn June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[371][372]\nIn August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.[373]\nBy the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[374] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[375]\nIn early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,[376] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[377]\nEarly in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.[378] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,\" an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"[379] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[380] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[381] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[382] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[383]\nIn October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[384]\nIn 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[385] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[386]\nIn June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"[387] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[388] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[389]\nIn 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"[390] In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"[391] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[392] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"[393]\nOn December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.[394] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions,[395][396] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.[397] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342\u201380 to condemn the UN Resolution.[398][399]\nIn February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[400] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[401] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi\u2014who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi[402]\u2014announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[403] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[404] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[405][406][407] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[408] Some Representatives[409] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[410][411]\nOn August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\"[412][413] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[414] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[415] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[416][417]\nIn the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged[418] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[419][420] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.[421][422]\nStarting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56\u00a0km) from Islamabad.[423] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[423] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[423] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[424][425] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[426] which was buried at sea several hours later.[427] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[424][428] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.[429]\nIn November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[430][431][432] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"[433] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.[434][435]\nSince the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.[436] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.[437] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[438]\nIn December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of d\u00e9tente.[439] Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"[440] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana.[441] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[442]\nObama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[443]\nObama spoke in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.[444][445] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.[446]\nOn May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.[447]\nAfter Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[448] Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.[449] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West,\" adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[450]\nObama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[451] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"[452] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"[453]\nObama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[454] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[455] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,[456][457] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.[458]\nAccording to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating[459] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,[460] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[461] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[462][463] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.[464] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.[465]\nPolls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[466][467] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[468] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[469][470]\nObama won Best Spoken Word Album Grammy Awards for abridged audiobook versions of Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.[471] His concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \"Yes We Can,\" which was viewed 10\u00a0million times on YouTube in its first month[472] and received a Daytime Emmy Award.[473] In December 2008 and in 2012, Time magazine named Obama as its Person of the Year.[474] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.\"[475] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following Charles de Gaulle in 1960, Nelson Mandela in 1996, Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.[476][477]\nOn October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"[478] Obama accepted this award in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"[479] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[480][481][482][483] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by The New York Times.[484] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[485] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect.[486]\nObama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the inauguration of his Republican successor, Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to Joint Base Andrews.[487] The family currently rents a house in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.[488]\nOn March 2, 2017, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"[489] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.[490] On May 4, three days ahead of the French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed Emmanuel Macron: \"He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France.\"[491] Macron went on to win the election.\nWhile in Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.[492] Obama traveled to Kensington Palace in England and met with Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.[493]\nAfter President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: \"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\"[494]\nAfter Senate Republicans revealed the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, on June 22, Obama released a Facebook post calling the bill \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\"[495] On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing \"a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.\"[496]\nAfter Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision.[497] Two days later, he partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[498]\nObama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation in Chicago on October 31. Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.[499] Obama has also been working on a Presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with Penguin Random House.[500]\nObama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China, India and France. In China, he delivered remarks at the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.[501][502] He then went to India, where he spoke at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit before meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi over lunch. In addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the Obama Foundation.[503][504] He also met with the Dalai Lama while in New Delhi.[505] He ended his five-day trip in France where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, former President Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.[506]\nBarack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas\u2019 newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"[507][508] Higher Ground's first film, American Factory, was nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar in 2020.[509]\nA package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Obama's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service during routine mail screenings. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of Donald Trump and to CNN. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. On October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in Manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.[510][511]\nIn 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha's Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck.[512][513]\nObama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal,\" have thus far failed.[514] Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[515][516][517][518]\nMany commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.[514] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3\u00a0million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term.[519] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[520]\nIn 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\nAs president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[521] In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.[522] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[523][234] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68% of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.[524]\nObama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.[525][526] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the US dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[527][528] Obama left about 8,400 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[529][530]\nAccording to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[531]\nObama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.[532][533] A 2018 survey of historians by the American Political Science Association ranked Obama the 8th-greatest American President.[4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked Obama the 18th-greatest American President.[534]\nThe Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library. It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago.[535]\n\n</body></html>"
