                "text": "no title\n\nRafael Edward Cruz (/kru\u02d0z/; born December 22, 1970) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States Senator for Texas since 2013. He was the runner-up for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 election. Cruz holds degrees in public policy and law from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, respectively. From 1999 to 2003, he held various government positions, serving as Director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as an Associate Deputy Attorney General at the United States Department of Justice, and as a Domestic Policy Advisor to George W. Bush during Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Cruz served as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008, having been appointed by Texas Attorney General and later Governor Greg Abbott. He was the longest-serving solicitor general in Texas history and the first Hispanic American to serve in that capacity. From 2004 to 2009, Cruz was an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, where he taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation. In 2012, Cruz ran for and won the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. He is the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. Senator from Texas. In 2016, Cruz ran for President of the United States, winning Republican contests in 12 states before withdrawing from the race. He was reelected to the Senate in 2018, defeating Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke by a slim margin of 50.9% to 48.3% in the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history. Along with Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio, Cruz is one of three current U.S. Senators of Cuban descent. Cruz was born Rafael Edward Cruz on December 22, 1970,[1][2] at Foothills Medical Centre[3][4] in Calgary, Alberta, to Eleanor Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz.[5][6][7][8] Eleanor Wilson was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s.[9] Cruz's father was born and raised in Cuba. He left in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the U.S. after his four-year student visa expired.[10] He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973[3] and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005.[7][11][12] At the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling.[7][13][14][15][16] Cruz has said that he is the son of \"two mathematicians/computer programmers.\"[17] In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas.[18] Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston.[3] They divorced in 1997.[19] Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011.[19][20][21] Cruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas;[22] and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988.[11][23][24] During high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat.[16][25] Cruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in public policy[26] from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[1][27] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[28] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.[28] Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia.[29][30][31] Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[31] Cruz's senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison: \"If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state.[9][32] After graduating from Princeton, Cruz attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree.[1][33] While at Harvard Law, he was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review.[27] Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, Professor Alan Dershowitz said, \"Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant\".[34][35][36][37] At Harvard Law, Cruz was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics.[38] Cruz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Texas Review of Law and Politics.[39] Cruz served as a law clerk to J. Michael Luttig of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 1995[38][40] and to William Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, in 1996.[1] He was the first Hispanic to clerk for a Chief Justice of the United States.[41] After Cruz finished his clerkships, he took a position with Cooper, Carvin & Rosenthal, now known as Cooper & Kirk, PLLC, from 1997 to 1998.[42] At the firm, Cruz worked on matters relating to the National Rifle Association and helped prepare testimony for the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.[43] In 1998, Cruz was briefly one of the attorneys who represented Representative John Boehner during his litigation against Representative Jim McDermott over the alleged leak of an illegal recording of a phone conversation whose participants included Boehner.[44][45] Cruz joined the George W. Bush presidential campaign in 1999 as a domestic policy adviser, advising then-Governor Bush on a wide range of policy and legal matters, including civil justice, criminal justice, constitutional law, immigration, and government reform.[42] During the 2000 Florida presidential recounts, he assisted in assembling the Bush legal team, devising strategy, and drafting pleadings for filing with the Supreme Court of Florida and U.S. Supreme Court in the case Bush v. Gore.[38][46] Cruz recruited future Chief Justice John Roberts and noted attorney Mike Carvin to Bush's legal team.[43] After Bush took office, Cruz served as an Associate Deputy Attorney General in the U.S. Justice Department[1][46] and as the director of policy planning at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.[1][34][46] Appointed to the office of Solicitor General of Texas by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott,[40][47] Cruz served in that position from 2003 to 2008.[25][38] The office was established in 1999 to handle appeals involving the state, but Abbott hired Cruz with the idea that Cruz would take a \"leadership role in the United States in articulating a vision of strict constructionism\". As Solicitor General, Cruz argued before the Supreme Court of the United States nine times, winning five cases and losing four.[43] Cruz authored 70 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and presented 43 oral arguments.[34][40][48] His nine appearances before the Supreme Court are the most by any practicing lawyer in Texas or current member of Congress.[49] Cruz has said, \"We ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country. There was a degree of serendipity in that, but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights.\"[49] In 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office declined to defend Texas's sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning homosexual sex were unconstitutional.[50] In the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller, Cruz drafted the amicus brief signed by the attorneys general of 31 states arguing that the Washington, D.C. handgun ban should be struck down as infringing upon the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.[48][51] He also presented oral argument for the amici states in the companion case to Heller before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[48][52] In addition to his success in Heller, Cruz successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 5\u20134 in Van Orden v. Perry.[34][38][48] In 2004, Cruz was involved in the high-profile case surrounding a challenge to the constitutionality of public schools' requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words \"under God\", legally a part of the Pledge since 1954), Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow.[34][38] He wrote a brief on behalf of all 50 states that argued that the plaintiff, a non-custodial parent, did not have standing to file suit on his daughter's behalf.[53] The Supreme Court upheld the position of Cruz's brief.[54] Cruz served as lead counsel for the state and successfully defended the multiple litigation challenges to the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting plan in state and federal district courts and before the U.S. Supreme Court, which was decided 5\u20134 in his favor in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry.[38][55] In Medellin v. Texas, Cruz successfully defended Texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, all of whom were convicted of murder in the United States and on death row.[34][38][40][48] With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate.[43][56] They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case, which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the US had breached its obligations under the Convention.[57] Texas won the case in a 6\u20133 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them.[43][56] Michael Wayne Haley was arrested for stealing a calculator from Walmart in 1997.[58] Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying \"I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors.\"[59] The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process.[59] After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to \"time served\".[60] In 2008 American Lawyer magazine named Cruz one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America,[47][61] and The National Law Journal named him one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America.[62][63] In 2010 Texas Lawyer named him one of the 25 Greatest Texas Lawyers of the Past Quarter Century.[64][65] After leaving the Solicitor General position in 2008, Cruz worked in a private law firm in Houston, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, often representing corporate clients, until he was sworn in as U.S. senator from Texas in 2013.[9][38][66] At Morgan Lewis, he led the firm's U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice.[66] In 2010, he abandoned a bid for state attorney general when incumbent Attorney General Greg Abbott, who hired Cruz as Solicitor General, decided to run for reelection.[11] At Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz represented Pfizer in a lawsuit brought by a group of public hospitals and community health centers, who accused Pfizer of overcharging.[67] Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award.[68] Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award.[68] Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case.[69] Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired 30 days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won a second appeal using the same argument.[70] Cruz defended two record-setting $54-million personal injury awards in New Mexico at the appellate level, including one that had been thrown out by a lower court.[71] He represented a mentally disabled man who was allegedly raped by an employee of the facility where he lived, and the family of a 78-year-old resident of an Albuquerque nursing home who died of internal bleeding.[71][72] The settlements were sealed in both cases.[71][72] Cruz's victory in the Republican primary was described by the Washington Post as \"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\".[73] On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek reelection, Cruz announced his candidacy via a blogger conference call.[74] In the Republican senatorial primary, Cruz ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin[75] and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee;[76] Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState,[77] the FreedomWorks for America super PAC,[78] nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin,[79] Tea Party Express,[80] Young Conservatives of Texas,[81] and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint,[82] Mike Lee,[83] Rand Paul[84] and Pat Toomey.[85] He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul,[86] George P. Bush,[46] and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum.[87] Former Attorney General Edwin Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign.[46] Cruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination by a 14-point margin over Dewhurst, support for Dewhurst having plummeted while Cruz's vote total dramatically increased from the first round.[88] Cruz won despite being outspent by Dewhurst, who held a statewide elected office,[89] $19 million to $7 million.[89][90] In the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote.[91] According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney with the Hispanic vote in Texas.[92][93] After Time magazine reported that Cruz might have violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, he called his failure to disclose the connection an inadvertent omission.[94] In January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out nearly $1 million in low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report them on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law.[95] Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the FEC form.[96] There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong.[96] The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \"inadvertent\" and that he would file supplementary paperwork.[95] As of November 2018, Cruz has sponsored 105 bills of his own, including:[97] Cruz had a leading role in the October 2013 government shutdown.[98][99][100] Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech in an effort to hold up a federal budget bill and thereby defund the Affordable Care Act.[99][101][102] During the speech, Cruz quoted from the book \"Green Eggs and Ham\" by Dr. Seuss.[103] Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill.[100] In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the filibuster attempt because only 18 Republican Senators supported the filibuster.[100] To supporters, the move \"signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government\".[99] This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz \"2013 Person of the Year\" in an op-ed in The Hill, primarily for his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act.[104] Cruz was also named \"2013 Man of the Year\" by conservative publications TheBlaze,[105] FrontPage Magazine,[106] and The American Spectator,[107] \"2013 Conservative of the Year\" by Townhall.com,[108] and \"2013 Statesman of the Year\" by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.[109][110] He was a finalist for Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" in 2013.[111] To critics, including some Republican colleagues[100] such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.[99] Cruz has consistently denied any involvement in the 2013 government shutdown, even though he cast several votes to prolong it and was blamed by many within his own party for prompting it.[112][113] On April 1, 2014, Cruz introduced S. 2195, a bill that would allow the President of the United States to deny visas to any ambassador to the United Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.[114] The bill was written in response to Iran's choice of Hamid Aboutalebi as its ambassador.[115] Aboutalebi was involved in the Iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of American diplomats from the US embassy in Tehran were held captive in 1979.[115][116][117] Under the headline \"A bipartisan message to Iran\", Cruz thanked President Barack Obama for signing S. 2195 into law. The letter, published in the magazine Politico on April 18, 2014, starts with \"Thanks to President Obama for joining a unanimous Congress and signing S. 2195 into law\". Cruz also thanked senators from both political parties for \"swiftly passing this legislation and sending it to the White House\".[118][119][120] In his first two years in the Senate, Cruz attended 17 of 50 public Armed Services Committee hearings, 3 of 25 Commerce Committee hearings, 4 of the 12 Judiciary Committee hearings, and missed 21 of 135 roll call votes during the first three months of 2015.[121] In a November 2014 Senate speech, Cruz accused the president of being \"openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this Republic\".[122] In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient Roman senator Cicero against Catiline to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform.[122] Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in The Atlantic, said that Cruz's analogy was \"deeply disquieting\" because \"In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.\"[122] Cruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran \"will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism\".[123] In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of \"outrageous attacks\" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: \"We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.\"[123] Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz for his remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was \"way over the line\" and \"hurts the cause\".[124][125] After the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz expressed his view that the winner of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, rather than Obama, should appoint a new Justice.[126] In June 2016, Cruz blamed the Obama administration for the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator Omar Mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watchlist.[127] Following the terrorist attack on Nice, France, Cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the Obama administration having a \"willful blindness\" to radical Islamists.[128] With the passing of Fidel Castro in November, Cruz charged Obama with celebrating and lionizing Castro in public statements he made addressing the death.[129] On December 28, after Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the U.S.'s decision to allow a U.N. resolution to pass that condemned Israeli settlements \"on land meant to be part of a future Palestinian state\", Cruz denounced the speech as \"disgraceful\", and said that history would remember Obama and Kerry as \"relentless enemies of Israel\". Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a \"radical anti-Israel agenda\".[130] Cruz, who was one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics during the 2016 presidential campaign, became an important ally of President Trump's in the Senate.[131][132] In late January 2017, after Trump announced Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee, Cruz praised Gorsuch as \"brilliant and immensely talented\" in a written statement.[133] On February 23, while speaking at the 2017 CPAC, Cruz showed interest in Trump nominating young justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas.[134] On March 1, Cruz called Trump's joint address to Congress the previous day \"positive\" and \"unifying\".[135] Cruz said that during his visit to the Mar-a-Lago estate on March 18, he spoke with affiliates of Trump while negotiating the American Health Care Act.[136] On April 6, shortly after the Shayrat missile strike, Cruz released a statement displaying his interest in having Trump appeal to Congress to take \"military action in Syria\" to prevent Islamic terrorists from acquiring weapons stored in Syria.[137] In April 2018, in the blurb for Trump's entry on the Time 100 most influential people of 2017, Cruz wrote, \"President Trump is doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo.\"[138] Cruz's authorship of the blurb was criticized by Charles Pierce of Esquire,[139] Jay Willis of GQ,[140] and CNN's Chris Cillizza.[138] In January 2020, after Iran attacked two U.S. military bases in Iraq, Cruz made comments about the change in Iran policy under President Trump, saying that Obama's policy was appeasement and that the missiles used to attack the bases were bought with money the Obama administration had given Iran.[141] Cruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow Republican politicians, and his relationships with various Republican members of Congress have been strained.[142][143] In 2013, Cruz called Republicans he thought were insufficiently resistant to Obama's proposals a \"surrender caucus\".[142] He also called fellow Republicans out as \"squishes\" on gun-control issues during a Tea Party rally.[142] Cruz's role in the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of Republican colleagues.[143] Republican Senator John McCain was reported to have particularly disliked Cruz; in a Senate floor speech in 2013, McCain denounced Cruz's reference to Nazis when discussing the Affordable Care Act.[143] In March 2013, McCain also called Cruz and others \"wacko birds\" whose beliefs are not \"reflective of the views of the majority of Republicans\".[143] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, John Boehner described Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\",[144] while during an interview, Lindsey Graham said, \"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\"[145] In a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling \"a flat-out lie\" over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. \"What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie\", Cruz said.[146] Cruz's \"incendiary outburst\" was \"unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate\", according to Reuters.[146][147] In the same speech, Cruz assailed the \"Republican majority in both houses of Congresses\" for what Cruz called an insufficiently conservative record.[147] Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with McCain saying that the speech was \"outside the realm of Senate behavior\" and \"a very wrong thing to do\".[148] Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: \"I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie.\"[149] Cruz alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; McConnell denied there was any \"deal\", and that denial was what Cruz called a \"lie\". Hatch said McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.[150] Among Cruz's few close allies in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah.[151][152] Cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in June 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting \"the Washington cartel\".[153] When Boehner announced in September 2015 that he would step down and resign from the House, Cruz expressed his concern that before resigning Boehner might have \"cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure\".[154] The following month, the budget agreement passed in the House by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from Democrats and Boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through March 2017, and Cruz called the agreement \"complete and utter surrender\".[155] Cruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the \"nuclear option\", \"to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees\". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would \"ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks\".[156] Cruz ran for reelection to a second term in 2018.[157] The primary elections for both parties were held on March 6, 2018.[158] He easily won the Republican nomination with over 80% of the vote. He faced the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, in the general election.[159] The contest was unusually competitive for an election in Texas, with most polls showing Cruz only slightly ahead of O'Rourke. The race received significant media attention[160] and became the most expensive U.S. Senate election in history.[161] On November 6, 2018, Cruz defeated O'Rourke by a margin of 50.9% to 48.3%.[162] As early as 2013, Cruz was widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016.[163][164][165] On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC.[166] He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast.[167] In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote.[168] Cruz finished first in two presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference[169] and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention.[170] Cruz did speaking events in mid-2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, all early primary states, leading to speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a run for President in 2016.[171] Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin described Cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue.[43] On April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United.[172] The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates.[173] In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words \"growth and opportunity\" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician.[172] Cruz delivered one of many State of the Union responses in January 2015.[174] On March 23, 2015, Cruz announced his 2016 presidential candidacy for the GOP primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.[175] Also, at the same hour, he posted on his Twitter page: \"I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!\"[176] He was the first announced major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign.[177][178] During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.[179][180] HarperCollins published Cruz's book A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America on June 30, 2015.[181] The book reached the bestseller list of several organizations in its first week of release.[182][183] In the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cruz received over 7.8 million votes,[184][185] won 12 states, and earned 559 delegates.[186] He raised nearly $92 million, a record for a GOP primary candidate, much of it from small online donors. The Cruz campaign had more than 325,000 volunteers.[187] On February 1, 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses.[188] The Iowa win made him the first Hispanic to win either a presidential primary election or caucus.[188][189][190] Cruz received 28% of the vote.[190] On February 10, 2016, Cruz placed third in the New Hampshire primary, with about 12% of the vote.[191] On February 21, 2016, he placed third in the South Carolina Republican primary with about 22.3% of the vote.[192] On March 1, 2016, Super Tuesday primary day, Cruz won Texas by 17%, along with Alaska and Oklahoma, providing him with four state primary victories total.[193] In the Texas primary, Cruz received the most votes in all but six of the state's 254 counties.[194] On March 5, 2016, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins.[195][196][197] Cruz won his widest margin up to that point in Kansas, where he beat frontrunner Donald Trump by 25 points.[198] With his victories over Trump in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, Cruz established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination.[199][200] On March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote\u2014defeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory.[201] He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii.[201] On March 12, 2016, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote and 9 delegates, giving him his eighth statewide win.[202] On March 22, 2016, Cruz won the Utah Caucus with 69.2% of the vote, versus John Kasich with 16.8% and Donald Trump with 14%.[203] Because Cruz surpassed the 50% winner-take-all threshold, he won all 40 of Utah's delegates. This win was his ninth. On April 3, 2016, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates that was dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates.[204] On April 6, 2016, Cruz won the Wisconsin primary with 48.2% of the vote, with Trump receiving 35.1%. It was Cruz's tenth statewide win. Cruz won 36 of the possible 42 delegates available in Wisconsin. Trump received the other 6 delegates. On April 2 and 7\u20139, 2016, Cruz swept the Colorado congressional district and state conventions taking all 34 delegates.[205][206][207][208] This gave Cruz his eleventh state win. On April 16, 2016, Cruz won all 14 of Wyoming's at-large delegates in the state convention. This secured the majority of state delegates giving Cruz his twelfth state win.[209] On April 27, 2016, Cruz announced that, if he were selected as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate.[210] Shortly after losing overwhelmingly to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016, Cruz officially announced his decision to suspend his campaign.[211] Cruz has stated that when he was a child, his mother told him that she would have to make an affirmative act to claim Canadian citizenship for him, so his family assumed that he did not hold Canadian citizenship.[212] In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that Cruz had dual Canadian-American citizenship,[213][214] he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.[212][215] Several lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that Cruz is ineligible to become U.S. president have been filed.[216][217][218][219][220][221][222] No lawsuit or challenge has been successful, and in February 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, \"The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\"[223] Shortly after the campaign's end, Cruz indicated that he would be interested in restarting the bid if he were successful in the Nebraska primary,[224] which Trump instead won.[225] In the months following, several publications noted that Cruz still had not endorsed Trump,[226][227] Cruz explaining in June that he was \"watching and assessing\" to determine if he would support him in the forthcoming general election.[228] On July 7, after a meeting with Trump, Cruz confirmed that he would be speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[229] In his speech on July 20, the third day of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him. He instead told listeners to \"vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution\". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd.[230] The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\"[231][232] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.[233] On October 10, following the 2005 audio recording of Trump being released and several Republicans retracting their endorsements, Cruz reaffirmed his support, citing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as being \"manifestly unfit to be President\".[234] On November 15, Cruz met with President-elect Trump at the Trump Tower in New York City. It had been reported that Trump was considering Cruz for the position of U.S. Attorney General, but the position ultimately went to Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.[235] On November 28, in light of Trump showing a softer tone on his campaign promises, Cruz warned that justified backlash could ensue if he strayed from them.[236] Cruz has been backed by the billionaire Mercer family, including Robert and his daughter Rebekah.[237] Cruz is a critic of the rapprochement between Communist Cuba and the United States, saying on Fox News in December 2014 that the thaw in relations was a \"manifestation of the failures of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy\" that \"will be remembered as a tragic mistake\".[238] In July 2018, Cruz spoke at the Rally for Religious Freedom in Asia. Cruz said, \"'It is a pleasure to be here and stand in solidarity for the men and women across this globe who have been persecuted by communists... We must stand united, in shining light, in highlighting heroism, in highlighting courage, in speaking out for those like my family, like so many millions across the globe who've seen the jackboot of communism firsthand.'\"[239] Cruz has called for an end to \"overcriminalization, harsh mandatory minimum sentences, and the demise of jury trials\".[240] He supports the death penalty.[241] In his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz frequently mentioned his role as counsel for the State of Texas in Medell\u00edn v. Texas, a 2008 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that Texas has the legal right to ignore an order from the International Court of Justice directing the U.S. to review the convictions and sentences of dozens of Mexican nationals on death row.[242] Cruz has referred to Medell\u00edn as the most important case of his tenure as Texas solicitor general.[242] Cruz is a gun-rights supporter,[243] and opposes expanding gun control regulations.[244] In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt discussing the attack that killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Cruz said that \"the simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats\", and that the reason Democrats are soft on crime, is that convicted felons tend to vote Democratic.[245] In August 2015, in the wake of the ambush death of a Texas police officer who was gunned down while filling up at a gas station, Cruz said that police are \"feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down, as we see \u2013 whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response from senior officials, the President or the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That's wrong. It's fundamentally wrong. It's endangering all of our safety and security.\"[246] Cruz opposes the legalization of marijuana, but believes it should be decided at the state level.[247] Following the legalization of marijuana in Colorado he stated that, \"If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I personally don't agree with it, but that's their right.\"[248] Cruz has been described by the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies as a \"free trader\"[249] and as a \"free-trade advocate\" by The Wall Street Journal.[250] In 2013, Cruz proposed the abolition of the IRS and the implementation of a flat tax \"where the average American can fill out taxes on a postcard\".[251] Cruz is \"adamantly opposed to a higher minimum wage\".[252] Cruz wants to decrease the size of the government significantly. In addition to eliminating the IRS as described above, he has promised to eliminate four other cabinet-level agencies. Cruz proposes to eliminate the Department of Energy, the Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.[253] Cruz is a proponent of school choice[254] and opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative.[255] Cruz rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[256][257] He has said that \"the scientific evidence doesn't support global warming\".[258] He has also stated: \"They call anyone who questions the science who even points to the satellite data \u2013 they call you a, quote, 'denier'. Denier is not the language of science. Denier is the language of religion. It is heretic. You are a blasphemer. It's treated as a theology. But it's about power and money. At the end of the day, it's not complicated. This is liberal politicians who want government power.\"[258] In March 2015, he said that some people are \"global warming alarmists\" and, citing satellite temperature measurements, said that there had been no significant warming in 18 years.[257][258][259] Cruz voted against the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 that would have created the National Endowment for the Oceans and authorized more than $26 billion in projects to be built by the Army Corps of Engineers, at least $16 billion of which would have come from federal taxpayers.[260][261] Cruz voted against the bill because it neglected \"to reduce a substantial backlog of projects, to the detriment of projects with national implications, such as the Sabine\u2013Neches Waterway\".[262] Cruz stated that the Corps' responsibilities were expanded without providing adequate measures for state participation.[262] Proponents of the bill argued that it would provide steady funding to support research and restoration projects, funded primarily by dedicating 12.5% of revenues from offshore energy development, including oil, gas, and renewable energy, through offshore lease sales and production based royalty payments, distributed through a competitive grant program.[263] In 2017, Cruz was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[264] to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Cruz has received more than $2.5 million in campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.[265] Cruz has a lifetime score of 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters.[266] Cruz is a supporter of TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline,[267] and along with every other Republican senator was a cosponsor of legislation in support of the pipeline.[268] In a 2014 opinion editorial in USA Today, Cruz wrote that auditing the Federal Reserve System was a top Republican priority in 2015 and that he supported legislation that would allow the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, whose confirmation Cruz had tried to prevent, said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed any audit of the Federal Reserve and that \"For 50 years Congress has recognized that there should be an exception to GAO ability to audit the Fed to avoid any political interference in monetary policy.\"[269][270] In 2015, Cruz voted in favor of the USA Freedom Act, which reauthorized the USA Patriot Act but reformed some of its provisions.[271][272] Cruz has been an adamant opponent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the U.S. and other world powers, calling it \"catastrophic\" and \"disastrous\".[273][274] In 2013, Cruz stated that America had no \"dog in the fight\" during the Syrian Civil War and stated that America's armed forces should not serve as \"al-Qaeda's air force\".[275] In 2014, Cruz criticized the Obama administration: \"The president's foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS, indeed, was working to arm Syrian rebels that were fighting side by side with ISIS\", calling ISIS \"the face of evil\". In a statement opposing US intervention for regime change in Syria, Cruz said, \"If President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Sen. Rubio succeed in toppling [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, the result will be the radical Islamic terrorists will take over Syria, that Syria will be controlled by ISIS, and that is materially worse for U.S. national security interests.\"[276] In September 2016, Cruz backed the Obama administration's plan to sell more than $1.15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[277] In early January 2017, Cruz, along with Texas governor Greg Abbott and some others met with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen. Cruz criticized the People's Republic of China after it reportedly made a statement asking members of Congress not to meet with Tsai.[278][279][280] On January 5, 2017, Cruz voted in favor of a House resolution condemning UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[281] In June 2017, Cruz co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[282][283] In August 2018, Cruz and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China's Xinjiang region.[284] They wrote: \"The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in \"political reeducation\" centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.\"[285] On December 18, 2018, Cruz and Senator Tom Cotton put forth a resolution in the U.S. Senate urging the United States to affirm Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.[286] Cruz is a strong critic of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA or \"Obamacare\"). He has sponsored legislation that would repeal the health care reform law and its amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Cruz was part of the group of 13 Senators that drafted the Senate version of the AHCA behind closed doors.[287][288][289][290] In 2013, Cruz voted against the bill to provide a package of federal aid to the East Coast for recovery from Hurricane Sandy.[291] Cruz said that he did not vote for Sandy disaster relief because the bill was \"filled with unrelated pork\" and that \"two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy\". The Washington Post disputed this, writing \"The bill was largely aimed at dealing with Sandy, along with relatively minor items to address other or future disasters.\"[292] The New York Times wrote that \"Of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one \u2014 $195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services \u2014 were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required.\"[293] In 2015, in the wake of fatal flooding in Texas, Cruz supported federal aid funding; in 2017, he called for federal intervention as Hurricane Harvey approached the coast of Texas.[294] Cruz adopted a \"hard-line stance\" on immigration issues during the 2014 border crisis[295] and is an opponent of comprehensive immigration reform.[43][295] Cruz advocates for an increase from 65,000 to 325,000 annually in skilled foreign workers entering the United States using H-1B visas.[296] According to McClatchy, Cruz staked out \"hard-right immigration stances\" during his 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination for President.[297] Cruz opposes providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children (so-called DREAMers).[298] In February 2018, he was the sole Senator to oppose a Republican motion to begin debate on legislation intended to resolve the question of what to do with DREAMers.[299] Cruz has called for the repeal of the clause of the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the United States.[300] Cruz defended the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents.[301][302] Cruz blamed the migrant parents for crossing the US border to seek asylum and argued that the Obama administration had the same policy.[301][302] Cruz opposes net neutrality\u2014which prevents Internet service providers from deliberately blocking or slowing particular websites\u2014arguing that the Internet economy has flourished in the United States simply because it has remained largely free from government regulation.[303] Cruz has argued that net neutrality is the \"Obamacare for the internet\".[304][305] Cruz said that the Obama-era implementation of the principle of net neutrality had the \"end result\" of \"less broadband, less innovation, and less freedom for the American consumer\".[305] In December 2017, after the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality, Cruz mocked supporters of net neutrality as \"snowflakes\" who were misled by \"online propaganda\".[306] On abortion, Cruz is \"strongly pro-life\" and \"would allow the procedure only when a pregnancy endangers the mother's life\".[307][308] He is in favor of cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.[309] Cruz opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[310] He believes that marriage should be legally defined as only \"between one man and one woman\",[311] but believes that the legality of same-sex marriage should be left to each state to decide.[312] Cruz referred to the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide as \"among the darkest hours of our nation\" and accused the court of judicial activism.[313] Cruz married Heidi Nelson on May 27, 2001;[314] they have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine.[315] The couple met when Cruz was working on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Heidi took leave from her position as head of the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman, Sachs & Co. in 2016 to support Ted Cruz's run for the U.S. president.[316] She previously worked in the White House for Condoleezza Rice and in New York as an investment banker.[317] Cruz has joked, \"I'm Cuban, Irish, and Italian, and yet somehow I ended up Southern Baptist.\"[318] He loves to wear cowboy boots, but he refrained from doing so when arguing before the Rehnquist court.[319] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

He was the runner-up for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 election.\nCruz holds degrees in public policy and law from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, respectively. From 1999 to 2003, he held various government positions, serving as Director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as an Associate Deputy Attorney General at the United States Department of Justice, and as a Domestic Policy Advisor to George W. Bush during Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Cruz served as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008, having been appointed by Texas Attorney General and later Governor Greg Abbott. He was the longest-serving solicitor general in Texas history and the first Hispanic American to serve in that capacity. From 2004 to 2009, Cruz was an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, where he taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation.\nIn 2012, Cruz ran for and won the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. He is the first Hispanic American to serve as a U.S. Senator from Texas. In 2016, Cruz ran for President of the United States, winning Republican contests in 12 states before withdrawing from the race. He was reelected to the Senate in 2018, defeating Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke by a slim margin of 50.9% to 48.3% in the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history. Along with Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio, Cruz is one of three current U.S. Senators of Cuban descent.\nCruz was born Rafael Edward Cruz on December 22, 1970,[1][2] at Foothills Medical Centre[3][4] in Calgary, Alberta, to Eleanor Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Darragh) Wilson and Rafael Cruz.[5][6][7][8] Eleanor Wilson was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She is of three-quarters Irish and one-quarter Italian descent, and earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rice University in the 1950s.[9]\nCruz's father was born and raised in Cuba. He left in 1957 to attend the University of Texas at Austin and obtained political asylum in the U.S. after his four-year student visa expired.[10] He earned Canadian citizenship in 1973[3] and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005.[7][11][12]\nAt the time of his birth, Ted Cruz's parents had lived in Calgary for three years and were working in the oil business as owners of a seismic-data processing firm for oil drilling.[7][13][14][15][16] Cruz has said that he is the son of \"two mathematicians/computer programmers.\"[17] In 1974, Cruz's father left the family and moved to Texas.[18] Later that year, Cruz's parents reconciled and relocated the family to Houston.[3] They divorced in 1997.[19] Cruz has two older half-sisters, Miriam Ceferina Cruz and Roxana Lourdes Cruz, from his father's first marriage. Miriam died in 2011.[19][20][21]\nCruz attended two private high schools: Faith West Academy, near Katy, Texas;[22] and Second Baptist High School in Houston, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1988.[11][23][24]\nDuring high school, Cruz participated in a Houston-based group known at the time as the Free Market Education Foundation, a program that taught high school students the philosophies of economists such as Milton Friedman and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat.[16][25]\nCruz graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in public policy[26] from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[1][27] While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel and won the top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship.[28] In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David Panton, Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.[28] Cruz and Panton later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semifinals to a team from Australia.[29][30][31] Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.[31]\nCruz's senior thesis at Princeton investigated the separation of powers; its title, Clipping the Wings of Angels, was inspired by a passage attributed to James Madison: \"If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" Cruz argued that the drafters of the Constitution intended to protect their constituents' rights, and that the last two items in the Bill of Rights offer an explicit stop against an all-powerful state.[9][32]\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Cruz attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1995 with a Juris Doctor degree.[1][33] While at Harvard Law, he was a primary editor of the Harvard Law Review, an executive editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and a founding editor of the Harvard Latino Law Review.[27] Referring to Cruz's time as a student at Harvard Law, Professor Alan Dershowitz said, \"Cruz was off-the-charts brilliant\".[34][35][36][37] At Harvard Law, Cruz was a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics.[38]\nCruz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Texas Review of Law and Politics.[39]\nCruz served as a law clerk to J. Michael Luttig of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 1995[38][40] and to William Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, in 1996.[1] He was the first Hispanic to clerk for a Chief Justice of the United States.[41]\nAfter Cruz finished his clerkships, he took a position with Cooper, Carvin &amp; Rosenthal, now known as Cooper &amp; Kirk, PLLC, from 1997 to 1998.[42] At the firm, Cruz worked on matters relating to the National Rifle Association and helped prepare testimony for the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.[43] In 1998, Cruz was briefly one of the attorneys who represented Representative John Boehner during his litigation against Representative Jim McDermott over the alleged leak of an illegal recording of a phone conversation whose participants included Boehner.[44][45]\nCruz joined the George W. Bush presidential campaign in 1999 as a domestic policy adviser, advising then-Governor Bush on a wide range of policy and legal matters, including civil justice, criminal justice, constitutional law, immigration, and government reform.[42] During the 2000 Florida presidential recounts, he assisted in assembling the Bush legal team, devising strategy, and drafting pleadings for filing with the Supreme Court of Florida and U.S. Supreme Court in the case Bush v. Gore.[38][46] Cruz recruited future Chief Justice John Roberts and noted attorney Mike Carvin to Bush's legal team.[43]\nAfter Bush took office, Cruz served as an Associate Deputy Attorney General in the U.S. Justice Department[1][46] and as the director of policy planning at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.[1][34][46]\nAppointed to the office of Solicitor General of Texas by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott,[40][47] Cruz served in that position from 2003 to 2008.[25][38] The office was established in 1999 to handle appeals involving the state, but Abbott hired Cruz with the idea that Cruz would take a \"leadership role in the United States in articulating a vision of strict constructionism\". As Solicitor General, Cruz argued before the Supreme Court of the United States nine times, winning five cases and losing four.[43]\nCruz authored 70 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and presented 43 oral arguments.[34][40][48] His nine appearances before the Supreme Court are the most by any practicing lawyer in Texas or current member of Congress.[49] Cruz has said, \"We ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country. There was a degree of serendipity in that, but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights.\"[49]\nIn 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office declined to defend Texas's sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws banning homosexual sex were unconstitutional.[50]\nIn the landmark case of District of Columbia v. Heller, Cruz drafted the amicus brief signed by the attorneys general of 31 states arguing that the Washington, D.C. handgun ban should be struck down as infringing upon the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.[48][51] He also presented oral argument for the amici states in the companion case to Heller before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[48][52]\nIn addition to his success in Heller, Cruz successfully defended the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 5\u20134 in Van Orden v. Perry.[34][38][48]\nIn 2004, Cruz was involved in the high-profile case surrounding a challenge to the constitutionality of public schools' requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words \"under God\", legally a part of the Pledge since 1954), Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow.[34][38] He wrote a brief on behalf of all 50 states that argued that the plaintiff, a non-custodial parent, did not have standing to file suit on his daughter's behalf.[53] The Supreme Court upheld the position of Cruz's brief.[54]\nCruz served as lead counsel for the state and successfully defended the multiple litigation challenges to the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting plan in state and federal district courts and before the U.S. Supreme Court, which was decided 5\u20134 in his favor in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry.[38][55]\nIn Medellin v. Texas, Cruz successfully defended Texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, all of whom were convicted of murder in the United States and on death row.[34][38][40][48] With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate.[43][56] They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case, which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the US had breached its obligations under the Convention.[57] Texas won the case in a 6\u20133 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them.[43][56]\nMichael Wayne Haley was arrested for stealing a calculator from Walmart in 1997.[58] Because of Haley's previous criminal convictions, he was sentenced to 16-and-a-half years in prison under the Texas habitual offender law. After Haley had exhausted his appeals, it became known that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before one of his other convictions was finalized; this raised a question about the applicability of the habitual offender statute in his case. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate Haley's sentence, saying \"I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors.\"[59] The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process.[59] After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to \"time served\".[60]\nIn 2008 American Lawyer magazine named Cruz one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America,[47][61] and The National Law Journal named him one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America.[62][63] In 2010 Texas Lawyer named him one of the 25 Greatest Texas Lawyers of the Past Quarter Century.[64][65]\nAfter leaving the Solicitor General position in 2008, Cruz worked in a private law firm in Houston, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP, often representing corporate clients, until he was sworn in as U.S. senator from Texas in 2013.[9][38][66] At Morgan Lewis, he led the firm's U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice.[66] In 2010, he abandoned a bid for state attorney general when incumbent Attorney General Greg Abbott, who hired Cruz as Solicitor General, decided to run for reelection.[11]\nAt Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, Cruz represented Pfizer in a lawsuit brought by a group of public hospitals and community health centers, who accused Pfizer of overcharging.[67] Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award.[68] Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award.[68] Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case.[69] Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired 30 days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won a second appeal using the same argument.[70]\nCruz defended two record-setting $54-million personal injury awards in New Mexico at the appellate level, including one that had been thrown out by a lower court.[71] He represented a mentally disabled man who was allegedly raped by an employee of the facility where he lived, and the family of a 78-year-old resident of an Albuquerque nursing home who died of internal bleeding.[71][72] The settlements were sealed in both cases.[71][72]\nCruz's victory in the Republican primary was described by the Washington Post as \"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\".[73] On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek reelection, Cruz announced his candidacy via a blogger conference call.[74] In the Republican senatorial primary, Cruz ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin[75] and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee;[76] Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState,[77] the FreedomWorks for America super PAC,[78] nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin,[79] Tea Party Express,[80] Young Conservatives of Texas,[81] and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint,[82] Mike Lee,[83] Rand Paul[84] and Pat Toomey.[85] He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul,[86] George P. Bush,[46] and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum.[87] Former Attorney General Edwin Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign.[46]\nCruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination by a 14-point margin over Dewhurst, support for Dewhurst having plummeted while Cruz's vote total dramatically increased from the first round.[88] Cruz won despite being outspent by Dewhurst, who held a statewide elected office,[89] $19 million to $7 million.[89][90]\nIn the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic nominee Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote.[91] According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney with the Hispanic vote in Texas.[92][93]\nAfter Time magazine reported that Cruz might have violated ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, he called his failure to disclose the connection an inadvertent omission.[94]\nIn January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out nearly $1 million in low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report them on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law.[95] Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the FEC form.[96] There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong.[96] The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \"inadvertent\" and that he would file supplementary paperwork.[95]\nAs of November 2018, Cruz has sponsored 105 bills of his own, including:[97]\nCruz had a leading role in the October 2013 government shutdown.[98][99][100] Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech in an effort to hold up a federal budget bill and thereby defund the Affordable Care Act.[99][101][102] During the speech, Cruz quoted from the book \"Green Eggs and Ham\" by Dr. Seuss.[103] Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill.[100] In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked the filibuster attempt because only 18 Republican Senators supported the filibuster.[100] To supporters, the move \"signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government\".[99] This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz \"2013 Person of the Year\" in an op-ed in The Hill, primarily for his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act.[104] Cruz was also named \"2013 Man of the Year\" by conservative publications TheBlaze,[105] FrontPage Magazine,[106] and The American Spectator,[107] \"2013 Conservative of the Year\" by Townhall.com,[108] and \"2013 Statesman of the Year\" by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.[109][110] He was a finalist for Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" in 2013.[111] To critics, including some Republican colleagues[100] such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.[99]\nCruz has consistently denied any involvement in the 2013 government shutdown, even though he cast several votes to prolong it and was blamed by many within his own party for prompting it.[112][113]\nOn April 1, 2014, Cruz introduced S. 2195, a bill that would allow the President of the United States to deny visas to any ambassador to the United Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States or its allies and may pose a threat to U.S. national security interests.[114] The bill was written in response to Iran's choice of Hamid Aboutalebi as its ambassador.[115] Aboutalebi was involved in the Iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of American diplomats from the US embassy in Tehran were held captive in 1979.[115][116][117]\nUnder the headline \"A bipartisan message to Iran\", Cruz thanked President Barack Obama for signing S. 2195 into law. The letter, published in the magazine Politico on April 18, 2014, starts with \"Thanks to President Obama for joining a unanimous Congress and signing S. 2195 into law\". Cruz also thanked senators from both political parties for \"swiftly passing this legislation and sending it to the White House\".[118][119][120]\nIn his first two years in the Senate, Cruz attended 17 of 50 public Armed Services Committee hearings, 3 of 25 Commerce Committee hearings, 4 of the 12 Judiciary Committee hearings, and missed 21 of 135 roll call votes during the first three months of 2015.[121]\nIn a November 2014 Senate speech, Cruz accused the president of being \"openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this Republic\".[122] In the same speech, Cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient Roman senator Cicero against Catiline to denounce Obama's planned executive actions on immigration reform.[122] Classics Professor Jesse Weiner, writing in The Atlantic, said that Cruz's analogy was \"deeply disquieting\" because \"In casting Obama in the role of Catiline, Cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... In effect, he accuses the president of high treason. Regardless of one's views on immigration reform and the Obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.\"[122]\nCruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran \"will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism\".[123] In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of \"outrageous attacks\" from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: \"We've had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.\"[123] Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz for his remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was \"way over the line\" and \"hurts the cause\".[124][125]\nAfter the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz expressed his view that the winner of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, rather than Obama, should appoint a new Justice.[126] In June 2016, Cruz blamed the Obama administration for the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator Omar Mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watchlist.[127] Following the terrorist attack on Nice, France, Cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the Obama administration having a \"willful blindness\" to radical Islamists.[128] With the passing of Fidel Castro in November, Cruz charged Obama with celebrating and lionizing Castro in public statements he made addressing the death.[129] On December 28, after Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the U.S.'s decision to allow a U.N. resolution to pass that condemned Israeli settlements \"on land meant to be part of a future Palestinian state\", Cruz denounced the speech as \"disgraceful\", and said that history would remember Obama and Kerry as \"relentless enemies of Israel\". Cruz also accused the Obama administration of having a \"radical anti-Israel agenda\".[130]\nCruz, who was one of Donald Trump's most vocal critics during the 2016 presidential campaign, became an important ally of President Trump's in the Senate.[131][132]\nIn late January 2017, after Trump announced Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee, Cruz praised Gorsuch as \"brilliant and immensely talented\" in a written statement.[133] On February 23, while speaking at the 2017 CPAC, Cruz showed interest in Trump nominating young justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas.[134] On March 1, Cruz called Trump's joint address to Congress the previous day \"positive\" and \"unifying\".[135] Cruz said that during his visit to the Mar-a-Lago estate on March 18, he spoke with affiliates of Trump while negotiating the American Health Care Act.[136] On April 6, shortly after the Shayrat missile strike, Cruz released a statement displaying his interest in having Trump appeal to Congress to take \"military action in Syria\" to prevent Islamic terrorists from acquiring weapons stored in Syria.[137]\nIn April 2018, in the blurb for Trump's entry on the Time 100 most influential people of 2017, Cruz wrote, \"President Trump is doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo.\"[138] Cruz's authorship of the blurb was criticized by Charles Pierce of Esquire,[139] Jay Willis of GQ,[140] and CNN's Chris Cillizza.[138]\nIn January 2020, after Iran attacked two U.S. military bases in Iraq, Cruz made comments about the change in Iran policy under President Trump, saying that Obama's policy was appeasement and that the missiles used to attack the bases were bought with money the Obama administration had given Iran.[141]\nCruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow Republican politicians, and his relationships with various Republican members of Congress have been strained.[142][143] In 2013, Cruz called Republicans he thought were insufficiently resistant to Obama's proposals a \"surrender caucus\".[142] He also called fellow Republicans out as \"squishes\" on gun-control issues during a Tea Party rally.[142] Cruz's role in the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of Republican colleagues.[143] Republican Senator John McCain was reported to have particularly disliked Cruz; in a Senate floor speech in 2013, McCain denounced Cruz's reference to Nazis when discussing the Affordable Care Act.[143] In March 2013, McCain also called Cruz and others \"wacko birds\" whose beliefs are not \"reflective of the views of the majority of Republicans\".[143] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, John Boehner described Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\",[144] while during an interview, Lindsey Graham said, \"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\"[145]\nIn a heated Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling \"a flat-out lie\" over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. \"What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie\", Cruz said.[146] Cruz's \"incendiary outburst\" was \"unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate\", according to Reuters.[146][147] In the same speech, Cruz assailed the \"Republican majority in both houses of Congresses\" for what Cruz called an insufficiently conservative record.[147] Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with McCain saying that the speech was \"outside the realm of Senate behavior\" and \"a very wrong thing to do\".[148] Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: \"I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie.\"[149] Cruz alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; McConnell denied there was any \"deal\", and that denial was what Cruz called a \"lie\". Hatch said McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.[150]\nAmong Cruz's few close allies in the Senate is Mike Lee of Utah.[151][152] Cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in June 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting \"the Washington cartel\".[153]\nWhen Boehner announced in September 2015 that he would step down and resign from the House, Cruz expressed his concern that before resigning Boehner might have \"cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of its tenure\".[154] The following month, the budget agreement passed in the House by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from Democrats and Boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through March 2017, and Cruz called the agreement \"complete and utter surrender\".[155]\nCruz is one of the Senate Republicans in favor of the \"nuclear option\", \"to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees\". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would \"ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks\".[156]\nCruz ran for reelection to a second term in 2018.[157] The primary elections for both parties were held on March 6, 2018.[158] He easily won the Republican nomination with over 80% of the vote. He faced the Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, in the general election.[159] The contest was unusually competitive for an election in Texas, with most polls showing Cruz only slightly ahead of O'Rourke. The race received significant media attention[160] and became the most expensive U.S. Senate election in history.[161]\nOn November 6, 2018, Cruz defeated O'Rourke by a margin of 50.9% to 48.3%.[162]\nAs early as 2013, Cruz was widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016.[163][164][165] On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington DC.[166] He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast.[167] In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote.[168] Cruz finished first in two presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference[169] and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention.[170]\nCruz did speaking events in mid-2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, all early primary states, leading to speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a run for President in 2016.[171] Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin described Cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue.[43]\nOn April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United.[172] The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates.[173] In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words \"growth and opportunity\" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician.[172]\nCruz delivered one of many State of the Union responses in January 2015.[174]\nOn March 23, 2015, Cruz announced his 2016 presidential candidacy for the GOP primaries and caucuses, in a morning speech delivered at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.[175] Also, at the same hour, he posted on his Twitter page: \"I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!\"[176] He was the first announced major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign.[177][178] During the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.[179][180]\nHarperCollins published Cruz's book A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America on June 30, 2015.[181] The book reached the bestseller list of several organizations in its first week of release.[182][183]\nIn the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cruz received over 7.8 million votes,[184][185] won 12 states, and earned 559 delegates.[186] He raised nearly $92 million, a record for a GOP primary candidate, much of it from small online donors. The Cruz campaign had more than 325,000 volunteers.[187]\nOn February 1, 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses.[188] The Iowa win made him the first Hispanic to win either a presidential primary election or caucus.[188][189][190] Cruz received 28% of the vote.[190] On February 10, 2016, Cruz placed third in the New Hampshire primary, with about 12% of the vote.[191] On February 21, 2016, he placed third in the South Carolina Republican primary with about 22.3% of the vote.[192]\nOn March 1, 2016, Super Tuesday primary day, Cruz won Texas by 17%, along with Alaska and Oklahoma, providing him with four state primary victories total.[193] In the Texas primary, Cruz received the most votes in all but six of the state's 254 counties.[194] On March 5, 2016, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins.[195][196][197]\nCruz won his widest margin up to that point in Kansas, where he beat frontrunner Donald Trump by 25 points.[198] With his victories over Trump in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, Cruz established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination.[199][200]\nOn March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote\u2014defeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory.[201] He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii.[201] On March 12, 2016, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote and 9 delegates, giving him his eighth statewide win.[202]\nOn March 22, 2016, Cruz won the Utah Caucus with 69.2% of the vote, versus John Kasich with 16.8% and Donald Trump with 14%.[203] Because Cruz surpassed the 50% winner-take-all threshold, he won all 40 of Utah's delegates. This win was his ninth. On April 3, 2016, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates that was dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates.[204]\nOn April 6, 2016, Cruz won the Wisconsin primary with 48.2% of the vote, with Trump receiving 35.1%. It was Cruz's tenth statewide win. Cruz won 36 of the possible 42 delegates available in Wisconsin. Trump received the other 6 delegates. On April 2 and 7\u20139, 2016, Cruz swept the Colorado congressional district and state conventions taking all 34 delegates.[205][206][207][208] This gave Cruz his eleventh state win. On April 16, 2016, Cruz won all 14 of Wyoming's at-large delegates in the state convention. This secured the majority of state delegates giving Cruz his twelfth state win.[209] On April 27, 2016, Cruz announced that, if he were selected as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his vice-presidential running mate.[210] Shortly after losing overwhelmingly to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016, Cruz officially announced his decision to suspend his campaign.[211]\nCruz has stated that when he was a child, his mother told him that she would have to make an affirmative act to claim Canadian citizenship for him, so his family assumed that he did not hold Canadian citizenship.[212] In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that Cruz had dual Canadian-American citizenship,[213][214] he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.[212][215]\nSeveral lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that Cruz is ineligible to become U.S. president have been filed.[216][217][218][219][220][221][222] No lawsuit or challenge has been successful, and in February 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, \"The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\"[223]\nShortly after the campaign's end, Cruz indicated that he would be interested in restarting the bid if he were successful in the Nebraska primary,[224] which Trump instead won.[225]\nIn the months following, several publications noted that Cruz still had not endorsed Trump,[226][227] Cruz explaining in June that he was \"watching and assessing\" to determine if he would support him in the forthcoming general election.[228] On July 7, after a meeting with Trump, Cruz confirmed that he would be speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[229]\nIn his speech on July 20, the third day of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him. He instead told listeners to \"vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution\". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd.[230] The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\"[231][232] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.[233]\nOn October 10, following the 2005 audio recording of Trump being released and several Republicans retracting their endorsements, Cruz reaffirmed his support, citing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as being \"manifestly unfit to be President\".[234] On November 15, Cruz met with President-elect Trump at the Trump Tower in New York City. It had been reported that Trump was considering Cruz for the position of U.S. Attorney General, but the position ultimately went to Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.[235] On November 28, in light of Trump showing a softer tone on his campaign promises, Cruz warned that justified backlash could ensue if he strayed from them.[236]\nCruz has been backed by the billionaire Mercer family, including Robert and his daughter Rebekah.[237]\nCruz is a critic of the rapprochement between Communist Cuba and the United States, saying on Fox News in December 2014 that the thaw in relations was a \"manifestation of the failures of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy\" that \"will be remembered as a tragic mistake\".[238]\nIn July 2018, Cruz spoke at the Rally for Religious Freedom in Asia. Cruz said, \"'It is a pleasure to be here and stand in solidarity for the men and women across this globe who have been persecuted by communists... We must stand united, in shining light, in highlighting heroism, in highlighting courage, in speaking out for those like my family, like so many millions across the globe who've seen the jackboot of communism firsthand.'\"[239]\nCruz has called for an end to \"overcriminalization, harsh mandatory minimum sentences, and the demise of jury trials\".[240] He supports the death penalty.[241] In his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz frequently mentioned his role as counsel for the State of Texas in Medell\u00edn v. Texas, a 2008 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that Texas has the legal right to ignore an order from the International Court of Justice directing the U.S. to review the convictions and sentences of dozens of Mexican nationals on death row.[242] Cruz has referred to Medell\u00edn as the most important case of his tenure as Texas solicitor general.[242]\nCruz is a gun-rights supporter,[243] and opposes expanding gun control regulations.[244]\nIn an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt discussing the attack that killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Cruz said that \"the simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats\", and that the reason Democrats are soft on crime, is that convicted felons tend to vote Democratic.[245]\nIn August 2015, in the wake of the ambush death of a Texas police officer who was gunned down while filling up at a gas station, Cruz said that police are \"feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down, as we see \u2013 whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response from senior officials, the President or the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement. That's wrong. It's fundamentally wrong. It's endangering all of our safety and security.\"[246]\nCruz opposes the legalization of marijuana, but believes it should be decided at the state level.[247] Following the legalization of marijuana in Colorado he stated that, \"If the citizens of Colorado decide they want to go down that road, that's their prerogative. I personally don't agree with it, but that's their right.\"[248]\nCruz has been described by the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies as a \"free trader\"[249] and as a \"free-trade advocate\" by The Wall Street Journal.[250] In 2013, Cruz proposed the abolition of the IRS and the implementation of a flat tax \"where the average American can fill out taxes on a postcard\".[251] Cruz is \"adamantly opposed to a higher minimum wage\".[252]\nCruz wants to decrease the size of the government significantly. In addition to eliminating the IRS as described above, he has promised to eliminate four other cabinet-level agencies. Cruz proposes to eliminate the Department of Energy, the Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.[253]\nCruz is a proponent of school choice[254] and opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative.[255]\nCruz rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[256][257] He has said that \"the scientific evidence doesn't support global warming\".[258] He has also stated: \"They call anyone who questions the science who even points to the satellite data \u2013 they call you a, quote, 'denier'. Denier is not the language of science. Denier is the language of religion. It is heretic. You are a blasphemer. It's treated as a theology. But it's about power and money. At the end of the day, it's not complicated. This is liberal politicians who want government power.\"[258] In March 2015, he said that some people are \"global warming alarmists\" and, citing satellite temperature measurements, said that there had been no significant warming in 18 years.[257][258][259]\nCruz voted against the Water Resources Development Act of 2013 that would have created the National Endowment for the Oceans and authorized more than $26 billion in projects to be built by the Army Corps of Engineers, at least $16 billion of which would have come from federal taxpayers.[260][261] Cruz voted against the bill because it neglected \"to reduce a substantial backlog of projects, to the detriment of projects with national implications, such as the Sabine\u2013Neches Waterway\".[262] Cruz stated that the Corps' responsibilities were expanded without providing adequate measures for state participation.[262] Proponents of the bill argued that it would provide steady funding to support research and restoration projects, funded primarily by dedicating 12.5% of revenues from offshore energy development, including oil, gas, and renewable energy, through offshore lease sales and production based royalty payments, distributed through a competitive grant program.[263]\nIn 2017, Cruz was one of 22 senators to sign a letter[264] to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Cruz has received more than $2.5 million in campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.[265] Cruz has a lifetime score of 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters.[266]\nCruz is a supporter of TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline,[267] and along with every other Republican senator was a cosponsor of legislation in support of the pipeline.[268]\nIn a 2014 opinion editorial in USA Today, Cruz wrote that auditing the Federal Reserve System was a top Republican priority in 2015 and that he supported legislation that would allow the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, whose confirmation Cruz had tried to prevent, said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed any audit of the Federal Reserve and that \"For 50 years Congress has recognized that there should be an exception to GAO ability to audit the Fed to avoid any political interference in monetary policy.\"[269][270]\nIn 2015, Cruz voted in favor of the USA Freedom Act, which reauthorized the USA Patriot Act but reformed some of its provisions.[271][272]\nCruz has been an adamant opponent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the U.S. and other world powers, calling it \"catastrophic\" and \"disastrous\".[273][274]\nIn 2013, Cruz stated that America had no \"dog in the fight\" during the Syrian Civil War and stated that America's armed forces should not serve as \"al-Qaeda's air force\".[275] In 2014, Cruz criticized the Obama administration: \"The president's foreign policy team utterly missed the threat of ISIS, indeed, was working to arm Syrian rebels that were fighting side by side with ISIS\", calling ISIS \"the face of evil\". In a statement opposing US intervention for regime change in Syria, Cruz said, \"If President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Sen. Rubio succeed in toppling [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, the result will be the radical Islamic terrorists will take over Syria, that Syria will be controlled by ISIS, and that is materially worse for U.S. national security interests.\"[276]\nIn September 2016, Cruz backed the Obama administration's plan to sell more than $1.15 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[277]\nIn early January 2017, Cruz, along with Texas governor Greg Abbott and some others met with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen. Cruz criticized the People's Republic of China after it reportedly made a statement asking members of Congress not to meet with Tsai.[278][279][280]\nOn January 5, 2017, Cruz voted in favor of a House resolution condemning UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[281]\nIn June 2017, Cruz co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[282][283]\nIn August 2018, Cruz and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China's Xinjiang region.[284] They wrote: \"The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in \"political reeducation\" centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.\"[285]\nOn December 18, 2018, Cruz and Senator Tom Cotton put forth a resolution in the U.S. Senate urging the United States to affirm Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.[286]\nCruz is a strong critic of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA or \"Obamacare\"). He has sponsored legislation that would repeal the health care reform law and its amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Cruz was part of the group of 13 Senators that drafted the Senate version of the AHCA behind closed doors.[287][288][289][290]\nIn 2013, Cruz voted against the bill to provide a package of federal aid to the East Coast for recovery from Hurricane Sandy.[291] Cruz said that he did not vote for Sandy disaster relief because the bill was \"filled with unrelated pork\" and that \"two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy\". The Washington Post disputed this, writing \"The bill was largely aimed at dealing with Sandy, along with relatively minor items to address other or future disasters.\"[292] The New York Times wrote that \"Of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one \u2014 $195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services \u2014 were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required.\"[293]\nIn 2015, in the wake of fatal flooding in Texas, Cruz supported federal aid funding; in 2017, he called for federal intervention as Hurricane Harvey approached the coast of Texas.[294]\nCruz adopted a \"hard-line stance\" on immigration issues during the 2014 border crisis[295] and is an opponent of comprehensive immigration reform.[43][295] Cruz advocates for an increase from 65,000 to 325,000 annually in skilled foreign workers entering the United States using H-1B visas.[296]\nAccording to McClatchy, Cruz staked out \"hard-right immigration stances\" during his 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination for President.[297]\nCruz opposes providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children (so-called DREAMers).[298] In February 2018, he was the sole Senator to oppose a Republican motion to begin debate on legislation intended to resolve the question of what to do with DREAMers.[299]\nCruz has called for the repeal of the clause of the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the United States.[300]\nCruz defended the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents.[301][302] Cruz blamed the migrant parents for crossing the US border to seek asylum and argued that the Obama administration had the same policy.[301][302]\nCruz opposes net neutrality\u2014which prevents Internet service providers from deliberately blocking or slowing particular websites\u2014arguing that the Internet economy has flourished in the United States simply because it has remained largely free from government regulation.[303] Cruz has argued that net neutrality is the \"Obamacare for the internet\".[304][305] Cruz said that the Obama-era implementation of the principle of net neutrality had the \"end result\" of \"less broadband, less innovation, and less freedom for the American consumer\".[305] In December 2017, after the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality, Cruz mocked supporters of net neutrality as \"snowflakes\" who were misled by \"online propaganda\".[306]\nOn abortion, Cruz is \"strongly pro-life\" and \"would allow the procedure only when a pregnancy endangers the mother's life\".[307][308] He is in favor of cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood.[309]\nCruz opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[310] He believes that marriage should be legally defined as only \"between one man and one woman\",[311] but believes that the legality of same-sex marriage should be left to each state to decide.[312] Cruz referred to the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide as \"among the darkest hours of our nation\" and accused the court of judicial activism.[313]\nCruz married Heidi Nelson on May 27, 2001;[314] they have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine.[315] The couple met when Cruz was working on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Heidi took leave from her position as head of the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in 2016 to support Ted Cruz's run for the U.S. president.[316] She previously worked in the White House for Condoleezza Rice and in New York as an investment banker.[317]\nCruz has joked, \"I'm Cuban, Irish, and Italian, and yet somehow I ended up Southern Baptist.\"[318] He loves to wear cowboy boots, but he refrained from doing so when arguing before the Rehnquist court.[319]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nBernard Sanders (born September\u00a08, 1941) is an American politician who has served as the junior United States Senator from Vermont since 2007. The U.S. Representative for the state's at-large congressional district from 1991 to 2007, he is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history and a member of the Democratic caucus. He ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president and is running again in 2020. A progressive and self-described democratic socialist, Sanders is known for his opposition to economic inequality. On domestic policy, he broadly supports labor rights, and has supported universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, tuition-free tertiary education, and an ambitious Green New Deal to create jobs addressing climate change. On foreign policy, he broadly supports reducing military spending, pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation, and putting greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements. Commentators have variously described his political philosophy as aligned with New Deal policies and social democracy, but not necessarily with true socialism\u2014characterized by the social ownership of the means of production\u2014and have noted the strong influence his views have had on Democratic Party politics since his 2016 presidential campaign.[2][3][4] Sanders was born into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. He attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was an active protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality as well as for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. As an independent, he was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 and reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district; he later co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as a U.S. Representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006; he was reelected to the Senate in 2012 and 2018. In April 2015, Sanders announced his campaign for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Despite initially low expectations, he went on to win 23 primaries and caucuses and approximately 43% of pledged delegates, to Hillary Clinton's 55%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for his rejection of large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. In July 2016, he formally endorsed Clinton in her general election bid against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the \"political revolution\" his campaign had begun. In February 2019, he announced a second presidential campaign, joining a large field of Democratic candidates pursuing the party nomination. Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York City.[5] His father, Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders (1904\u20131962),[6] was born in S\u0142opnice, Galicia, in Austria-Hungary (now part of Poland),[7][8] to a Jewish family. In 1921, Elias immigrated to the United States, where he became a paint salesman.[7][9][10] His mother, Dorothy Sanders (n\u00e9e\u00a0Glassberg, 1912\u20131960), was born in New York City[11][12] to Jewish immigrant parents from Poland and Russia.[13][14] Sanders became interested in politics at an early age: \"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932. He won an election, and 50 million people died as a result of that election in World War II, including six million Jews. So what I learned as a little kid is that politics is, in fact, very important.\"[b][17] In the 1940s, many of his relatives in German-occupied Poland were murdered in the Holocaust.[18] Sanders lived in Midwood, Brooklyn.[19] He attended elementary school at P.S. 197 in Brooklyn, where he won a borough championship on the basketball team.[20][21] He attended Hebrew school in the afternoons, and celebrated his bar mitzvah in 1954.[22] His older brother, Larry, said that during their childhood, the family never lacked for food or clothing, but major purchases, \"like curtains or a rug\", were not affordable.[23] Sanders attended James Madison High School, also in Brooklyn, where he was captain of the track team and took third place in the New York City indoor one-mile race.[20] In high school, he lost his first election, finishing last out of three candidates for the student body presidency. Not long after his high school graduation, his mother died at the age of 46.[12][22] His father died a few years later on August 4, 1962, at the age of 57.[8] Sanders studied at Brooklyn College for a year in 1959\u20131960[24] before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in political science in 1964.[24] He has described himself as a mediocre college student because the classroom was \"boring and irrelevant\", while the community was more important to his education.[25] Sanders later described his time in Chicago as \"the major period of intellectual ferment in my life\".[26] While there, he joined the Young People's Socialist League (the youth affiliate of the Socialist Party of America)[27] and was active in the Civil Rights Movement as a student for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).[28][29] Under his chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of the SNCC.[30] In January 1962, he went to a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. \"We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,\" Sanders said at the protest. He and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president's office.[31][32] After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination.[33] Following further protests, the University of Chicago ended official racial segregation in private university housing in the summer of 1963.[26] Joan Mahoney, a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described him in a 2016 interview as \"a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn't terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn't agree with\".[34] He once spent a day putting up fliers protesting police brutality, only to eventually notice that Chicago police had shadowed him and taken them all down.[31] Sanders attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave the \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[28][31][35] That summer, he was fined $25 (equivalent to $209 in 2019) for resisting arrest during a demonstration in Englewood against segregation in Chicago's public schools.[26][36][37] In addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s,[38] Sanders was active in several peace and antiwar movements while attending the University of Chicago. He was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Student Peace Union. He applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be drafted. Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought in it, and he has long been a strong supporter of veterans' benefits.[39][40] He also was briefly an organizer with the United Packinghouse Workers of America while in Chicago.[26] He also worked on the reelection campaign of Leon Despres, a prominent Chicago alderman who was opposed to mayor Richard J. Daley's Democratic Party machine. During his student years, Sanders also read a variety of American and European political authors, from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and John Dewey to Karl Marx and Erich Fromm.[41] After graduating from college, Sanders returned to New York City, where he briefly had a variety of jobs, including Head Start teacher, psychiatric aide, and carpenter.[25] In 1968 he moved to Stannard, Vermont, a town small in both area and population (88 residents at the 1970 census) within Vermont's extremely rural \"Northeast Kingdom\" region, because he had been \"captivated by rural life\". While there he worked as a carpenter,[27] filmmaker, and writer[42] who created and sold \"radical film strips\" and other educational materials to schools.[43] He also wrote several articles for the alternative publication The Vermont Freeman.[44] He lived in the area for several years before moving to the more populous Chittenden County in the mid-1970s. During Sanders's 2018 reelection campaign, he returned to the town to hold an event with voters and other candidates on November 3, three days before the election,[45] during which he told stories of his early years living in the town, with his former residence less than a mile from the meeting hall where the event was held.[46] Sanders began his electoral political career in 1971 as a member of the Liberty Union Party, which originated in the anti-war movement and the People's Party. He ran as the Liberty Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate for U.S. senator in 1972 and 1974.[47] In the 1974 senatorial race, he finished third (5,901 votes; 4%), behind 33-year-old Chittenden County State's Attorney Patrick Leahy (D, VI; 70,629 votes; 49%) and two-term incumbent U.S. Representative Dick Mallary (R; 66,223 votes; 46%).[48][49] The 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union's influence, with Sanders collecting 11,000 votes for governor and the party. This forced the races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the Republican or Democratic candidates for those offices from garnering a majority of votes.[50] The campaign drained the finances and energy of the Liberty Union, however, and in October 1977, less than a year after the 1976 campaign concluded, he and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party.[50] Following his resignation from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, Sanders worked as a writer and as the director of the nonprofit American People's Historical Society (APHS).[51] While with the APHS, he produced a 30-minute documentary about American labor leader Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president five times for the Socialist Party.[27][52] In 1980, Sanders ran for mayor of Burlington, Vermont (pop. 38,000), at the urging of his close friend and political confidant Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont. He was mayor for eight years, from April 6, 1981, to April 4, 1989.[53] The 39-year-old Sanders ran against incumbent Democratic mayor Gordon \"Gordie\" Paquette, a five-term mayor who had served as a member of the Burlington City Council for 13 years before that, building extensive community ties and a willingness to cooperate with Republican leaders in controlling appointments to various commissions. Republicans had found Paquette so unobjectionable that they failed to field a candidate in the March 1981 race against him, leaving Sanders as his principal opponent. Sanders' effort was further aided by Citizens Party candidate Greg Guma's decision to exit the race so as not to split the progressive vote. Two other candidates in the race, independents Richard Bove and Joe McGrath, were non-factors in the campaign, with the battle coming down to Paquette and Sanders.[50] Sanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders was elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as by a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The final result came as a shock to the local political establishment when Sanders won by just 10 votes.[50] Sanders was reelected three times, defeating both Democratic and Republican candidates. He received 53% of the vote in 1983 and 55% in 1985.[54] In his final run for mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated Paul Lafayette, a Democrat endorsed by both major parties.[55] In 1986, he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Governor Madeleine Kunin (D) in her run for reelection. Running as an independent, he finished third with 14% of the vote, while Kunin won with 47%, followed by Lt. Governor Peter P. Smith (R) with 38%. After serving four two-year terms, Sanders chose not to seek reelection in 1989. He went on to lecture in political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government that year and at Hamilton College in 1991.[56] During his mayoralty, Sanders called himself a socialist and was so described in the press.[57][58] During his first term his supporters, including the first Citizens Party city councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party.[59] The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under Sanders, Burlington became the first U.S. city to fund community-trust housing.[60] During the 1980s, Sanders was a consistent critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America.[61] In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by Noam Chomsky. In his introduction, he praised Chomsky as \"a very vocal and important voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America\" and said that he was \"delighted to welcome a person who I think we're all very proud of.\"[62][63] Sanders's administration balanced the city budget and drew a minor league baseball team, the Vermont Reds, then the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, to Burlington.[12] Under his leadership, Burlington sued the local television cable franchise, thereby winning reduced rates for customers.[12] As mayor, Sanders led extensive downtown revitalization projects. One of his primary achievements was improving Burlington's Lake Champlain waterfront.[12] In 1981, he campaigned against the unpopular plans by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial[64] waterfront property owned by the Central Vermont Railway into expensive condominiums, hotels, and offices.[65] He ran under the slogan \"Burlington is not for sale\" and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the waterfront area into a mixed-use district featuring housing, parks, and public spaces.[65] Sanders hosted and produced a public-access television program, Bernie Speaks with the Community, from 1986 to 1988.[66][67] He collaborated with 30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, We Shall Overcome, in 1987.[68][69] In 1987, U.S. News & World Report ranked Sanders one of America's best mayors.[70] As of 2013[update] Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the United States.[71][72] In 1988, incumbent Republican congressman Jim Jeffords decided to run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing Vermont's at-large congressional district. Former Lieutenant Governor Peter P. Smith (R) won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic State Representative Paul N. Poirier placed third with 19%.[73] Two years later, he ran for the seat again and defeated Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.[74] Sanders was the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Frazier Reams's election to represent Ohio 40 years earlier.[75] The Washington Post and other news media noted that it was the first election of a socialist to the United States House of Representatives in decades.[76][75] Sanders served as a representative for 16 years, from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 Republican Revolution, when he won by 3%, with 50% of the vote.[77] During his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as working primarily on behalf of the wealthy. In 1991, he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of mostly liberal Democrats that Sanders chaired for its first eight years,[12] while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.[78] In 2005, Rolling Stone called Sanders the \"amendment king\" for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control. Sanders' position as an Independent allowed him to form coalitions across party lines.[79] In 1999, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the Glass\u2013Steagall Legislation provisions that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate entities.[80] He was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion with the then-Chairman, Sanders told him he was concerned that Greenspan was \"way out of touch\" and \"that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations\".[81][82][83][84] Concerned by high breast cancer rates in Vermont, on February 7, 1992, Sanders sponsored the Cancer Registries Amendment Act to establish cancer registries to collect data on cancer.[85][86] Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a companion bill in the Senate on October 2, 1992. The Senate bill was passed by the House on October 6 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on October 24, 1992.[87] In 1993, Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks when buying guns and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238\u2013187.[88][89] He voted against the bill four more times in the 1990s, explaining his Vermont constituents (high on hunting, low on homicide) saw waiting-period mandates as more appropriately a state than federal matter. Sanders did vote for other gun-control measures.[90][88] For example, in 1994 he voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \"because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons\". He was nevertheless extremely critical of the other parts of the bill.[91][92] Although he acknowledged that \"clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them\", he maintained that governmental policies played a large part in \"dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence\" and argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, saying, \"we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails\".[93] In 1998, Sanders voted for a bill that would have increased minimum sentencing for possession of a gun while committing a federal crime to 10 years in prison, including nonviolent crimes such as marijuana possession.[94][88][95] In 2005, Sanders voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.[96] The act's purpose was to prevent firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products.[97] As of 2016[update] he said that he has since changed his position and would vote for legislation to defeat this bill.[98] Sanders was a consistent critic of the Patriot Act.[99] As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation.[100] After its 357\u201366 passage in the House, he sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects[101] and voted against each reauthorization.[102] In June 2005, he proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November\u00a04 of that year in House\u2013Senate negotiations and never became law.[103] Sanders voted against the resolutions authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists[104] that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks.[105] He voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the George W. Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the investigation of what turned out to be a leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department official, he stated: \"The revelation that the President authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is now for a serious investigation of how we got into the war in Iraq and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President.\"[106] In 1996, Sanders voted against a bill that would have prohibited the purchasing of tanks and armored carriers by police.[94][107] On November 2, 2005, Sanders voted against the Online Freedom of Speech Act, which would have exempted the Internet from the campaign finance restrictions of the McCain\u2013Feingold Bill.[108] Sanders entered the race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, after Senator Jim Jeffords announced that he would not seek a fourth term. Chuck Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, endorsed Sanders, a critical move as it meant that no Democrat running against him could expect to receive financial help from the party. He was also endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Democratic National Committee chairman and former Vermont governor Howard Dean. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who \"votes with the Democrats 98% of the time.\"[109] Then-Senator Barack Obama also campaigned for him in Vermont in March 2006.[110] Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did.[111][112] In the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history,[113] he defeated businessman Rich Tarrant by an approximately 2-to-1 margin. Many national media outlets projected Sanders as the winner just after the polls closed, before any returns came in. He was reelected in 2012 with 71% of the vote,[114] and in 2018 with 67% of the vote.[115] While a member of Congress, Sanders sponsored 15 concurrent resolutions and 15 Senate resolutions,[116] two of which passed, expressing the Senate's views on policy or commemorative questions.[117] Of the bills he sponsored two became law, including Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013 and of those he co-sponsored, 218 became law.[118][119] He has sponsored over 500 amendments to bills,[120] many of which became law. The results of these amendments include a ban on imported goods made by child labor; $100 million in funding for community health centers in 2002; $10 million for an outreach program for servicemembers suffering from PTSD, traumatic brain injury, depression, panic attacks, etc.; a public database of senior Department of Defense officials seeking employment with defense contractors; and inclusion of autism treatment in the military healthcare program.[121] In 2008 and 2009, Sanders voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP, also known as the Wall Street bailout), a program to purchase toxic banking assets and provide loans to banks that were in free-fall.[122][123] On February 4, 2009, he sponsored an amendment to ensure that TARP funds would not displace US workers. The amendment passed and was added to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[121][124] Among his proposed financial reforms is the auditing of the Federal Reserve, which would reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve in monetary policy deliberations; Federal Reserve officials say that \"Audit the Fed\" legislation would expose the Federal Reserve to undue political pressure from lawmakers who do not like its decisions.[125][126][127] On December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an \u200b8\u00a01\u20442\u2013hour speech against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, the proposed extension of the Bush-era tax rates that eventually became law, arguing that the legislation would favor the wealthiest Americans. \"Enough is enough!\u00a0... How many homes can you own?\" he asked.[128][129][130] A long speech such as this is commonly known as a filibuster, but because it did not block action, it was not technically a filibuster under Senate rules.[131] In response to the speech, hundreds of people signed online petitions urging Sanders to run in the 2012 presidential election, and pollsters began measuring his support in key primary states.[132] Progressive activists such as Rabbi Michael Lerner and economist David Korten publicly voiced their support for a prospective Sanders run against President Obama.[132] His speech was published in February 2011 by Nation Books as The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class, with authorial proceeds going to Vermont nonprofit charitable organizations.[133] In 2016, Sanders voted for the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, which included proposals for a reformed audit of the Federal Reserve System.[125][126][127] On June 12, 2017, U.S. senators reached an agreement on legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia and Iran.[134] The bill was opposed only by Sanders and Republican Rand Paul.[135] He supported the sanctions on Russia, but voted against the bill because he believed the sanctions could endanger the Iran nuclear deal.[136] In 2018, Sanders sponsored a bill and was joined by Senators Chris Murphy (D\u2013CT) and Mike Lee (R\u2013UT) to invoke the 1973 War Powers Resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen,[137] which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties[138] and \"millions more suffering from starvation and disease\".[139][140] After the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 (which, according to multiple intelligence agencies, was ordered by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman),[141] His bill attracted bipartisan co-sponsors and support, and the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 56\u201341.[142][137][138][139][141] [137] The bill passed the House in February 2019 by a 247-175 vote and President Trump vetoed it in March, saying, \u201cThis resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.\"[143] In mid-December 2009, Sanders successfully added a provision to the Affordable Care Act to fund $11 billion to community health centers, especially those in rural areas. The provision brought together Democrats on the left with Democrats from conservative, rural areas, helping to secure the 60 votes needed for passage.[121] On May 4, 2017, in response to the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, he predicted \"thousands of Americans would die\" from no longer having access to health care.[144] PolitiFact rated his statement \"mostly true\".[145] In September 2017, Sanders along with 15 Senate co-sponsors submitted the Medicare for All bill, a single-payer health care plan. The bill covers vision and dental care, unlike Medicare. Some Republicans have called the bill \"Berniecare\" and \"the latest Democratic push for socialized medicine and higher taxes.\" He responded that the Republican party has no credibility on the issue of health care after voting for legislation that would take health insurance away from 32 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act]].[146] As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, Sanders has introduced legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Older Americans Act, which supports Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors.[147] In 2007, Sanders helped kill a bill introducing comprehensive immigration reform, arguing that its guest-worker program would depress wages for American workers.[148] In 2010, he supported the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as minors.[148] In 2013, he supported the Gang of Eight's comprehensive immigration reform bill after advocating for the provision of a $1.5 billion youth jobs program, which he argued would offset the harm of labor market competition with immigrants.[148] In April 2017, Sanders introduced a bill that would raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $15 an hour, an increase over an earlier Democratic $12/hour proposal.[149] On May 9, 2018, he introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, a bill that would expand labor rights by making it easier for workers to join a union, ban right-to-work laws and some anti-union provisions of the Taft Hartley Act, and outlaw some union-busting tactics. Announcing the legislation, he said, \"If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.\"[150] Sanders opposed the 2018 United States federal budget proposed by the Trump administration, calling it \"a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country\u00a0... nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%\".[151] Following the November 2017 revelations from the Paradise Papers and a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies which says just three people, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett, own more wealth than the bottom half of the U.S. population, Sanders stated that \"we must end global oligarchy\" and that \"we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent.\"[152] On September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with Ro Khanna to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, rather than shifting the burden onto taxpayers.[153][154] On June 9, 2014, Sanders sponsored the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs in the wake of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014. He worked with Senator John McCain, who co-sponsored the bill.[155][156] His bill was incorporated into the House version of the bill, which passed both chambers on July 31, 2014, and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on August 7, 2014.[157] On March 17, 2016, Sanders said he would support Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, though he added, \"there are some more progressive judges out there.\"[158] He opposed Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Court, saying that Gorsuch had \"refused to answer legitimate questions.\"[159] He also objected to the possibility of Senate Republicans using the nuclear option to \"choke off debate and ram the nomination through the Senate.\"[159] He voted against Gorsuch's confirmation as an associate justice.[160] Senators participate in committees that are responsible for certain types of legislation and in caucuses that build a legislative constituency for shaping legislation of interest to its members. As an independent, Sanders worked out a deal with the Senate Democratic leadership in which he agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless the Democratic whip, Dick Durbin, agreed that he need not (a request rarely made or granted). In return he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013\u201314 he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (during the Veterans Health Administration scandal).[161][162] Sanders became the ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee in January 2015; he had previously chaired the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for two years. Since January 2017 he has been Chair of the Senate Democratic Outreach Committee.[162] He appointed economics professor Stephanie Kelton, a modern monetary theory scholar, as the chief economic adviser for the committee's Democratic minority and presented a report aimed at helping \"rebuild the disappearing middle class\", which included proposals to raise the minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, and increase Social Security payments.[163] According to his senate website, Sanders's other committee assignments during 2016 were as follows:[164] Sanders was only the third senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51\u201349 majority in the Senate during the 110th Congress in 2007\u201308. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would likely have broken any tie in favor of the Republicans.[165] He is a member of the following caucuses: Polling conducted in August 2011 by Public Policy Polling found that Sanders's approval rating was 67% and his disapproval rating 28%, making him then the third-most popular U.S. senator.[167] Both the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and the NHLA (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) have given him 100% voting scores during his tenure in the Senate.[168] In 2015, he was named one of the Top\u00a05 of The Forward 50.[169] In a November 2015 Morning Consult poll, he reached an approval rating of 83% among his constituents, making him the most popular U.S. senator.[170] Fox News found him to have the highest net favorability at +28 points of any prominent politician included in its March 2017 poll.[171] He ranked third in 2014 and first in both 2015 and 2016.[170][167][172] In April 2017, a nationwide Harvard-Harris Poll found that Sanders had the highest favorability rating among the political figures included in the poll,[173] a standing confirmed by subsequent polling.[174] In November 2013 Sanders suggested that Senator Elizabeth Warren could be president and that she might earn his backing if she ran. He added that if no progressive candidate ran, he might feel compelled to do so himself.[175][176] In December 2014 Warren said she was not running.[177] Sanders announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president on April 30, 2015,[178][179][180] and his campaign was officially launched on May 26, 2015, in Burlington.[179] In his announcement, Sanders said, \"I don't believe that the men and women who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process,\" and made this a central idea throughout his campaign.[178][179] Warren welcomed Sanders's entry into the race, saying, \"I'm glad to see him get out there and give his version of what leadership in this country should be,\" but never endorsed him.[181][182] Initially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 primaries and caucuses and approximately 46% of pledged delegates to Clinton's 54%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for his rejection of large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. Some of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails leaked to the public in June and July 2016 showed that the committee leadership had favored Clinton over him and had worked to help Clinton win the nomination.[183] On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton in her unsuccessful general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the \"political revolution\" his campaign had begun.[184] Unlike the other major candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a Super PAC or by wealthy donors, instead focusing on small individual donations.[185] His presidential campaign raised $1.5\u00a0million within 24 hours of his official announcement.[186] At year's end the campaign had raised a total of $73\u00a0million from more than one million people making 2.5\u00a0million donations, with an average donation of $27.16.[187] The campaign reached 3.25\u00a0million donations by the end of January 2016, raising $20\u00a0million in that month alone.[188] Sanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum,[189] posting content to online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and answering questions on Reddit. He gained a large grassroots organizational following online. A July 29, 2015 meetup organized online brought 100,000 supporters to more than 3,500 simultaneous events nationwide.[190] Sanders's June 2015 campaign events drew overflow crowds around the country, to his surprise.[191][192][193] When Hillary Clinton and Sanders made public appearances within days of each other in Des Moines, Iowa, he drew larger crowds, even though he had already made numerous stops around the state and Clinton's visit was her first in 2015.[194] On July 1, 2015, his campaign stop in Madison, Wisconsin, drew the largest crowd of any 2016 presidential candidate to that date, with an estimated turnout of 10,000.[195][196] Over the following weeks, he drew even larger crowds: 11,000 in Arizona,[197] 15,000 in Seattle,[198] and 28,000 in Portland, Oregon.[199] The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates pitted candidates in the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for the President of the United States. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton.[200] In February 2016 Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten.[201] Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just before the California primary, citing a need to devote her time to making direct contact with California voters and preparing for the general election.[202] He expressed his disappointment that Clinton should cancel the debate \"before the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process\".[203] Some supporters raised concerns that publications such as The New York Times minimized coverage of the Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates, especially Trump and Clinton. The Times's ombudsman reviewed her paper's coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that as of September\u00a02015[update] the Times \"hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.\" She also found that the Times's coverage of his campaign was much scanter than its coverage of Trump's, though Trump's was also initially considered a long shot at that time, with 63 articles covering the Trump campaign and 14 covering Sanders's.[204][205] A December 2015 report found that the three major networks\u2014CBS, NBC, and ABC\u2014had spent 234\u00a0minutes reporting on Trump and 10\u00a0minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that ABC World News Tonight had spent 81\u00a0minutes on Trump and less than one\u00a0minute on Sanders during 2015.[206] Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! noted that on March 15, Super Tuesday III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz were broadcast in full. Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona, on that date, speaking to a rally larger than any of the others, yet his speech was not mentioned, let alone broadcast.[207] An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted in May 2016 found Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in a \"dead heat\", but the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump.[208] Clinton and Trump were the least popular among likely candidates in the poll's entire history, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating.[209] Polls showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but that those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders.[210] A 2017 analysis in Newsweek found that 12% of those who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the general election, enough to swing the election in his favor. By comparison, 25% of those who voted for Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary voted for Republican nominee John McCain in the general election.[211] In July 2016, a leak of the Democratic National Committee's emails appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders. Staff repeatedly discussed the possibility of making Sanders's irreligious tendencies a campaign issue in southern states, questioned Sanders's party loyalty, and DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz referred to Sanders's campaign manager as \"an ASS\" and \"a damn liar\".[212] Speaking on CNN, Sanders responded to the email leak: \"it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates \u2014 to be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\"[213] After the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee.[214] On July 12 Sanders formally endorsed Clinton,[215] and he continued to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement the progressive positions for which he had campaigned. He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, \"Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton\u00a0... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency.\"[216] On November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history.[217] He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined.[218] It was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states,[219] and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: California,[220] New Hampshire,[221] and Vermont.[218] In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, approximately 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.[219] In November 2016, Sanders's book Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In was released; upon its release, it was number\u00a03 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[222] The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.[223] In February 2017, he began webcasting The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook live streaming. As of April\u00a02, 2017[update], guests had included William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye. [224][225] Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.[173][226] In February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election revealed that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to benefit Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton.[227] Sanders rejected the investigation's conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign.[228] Furthermore, he blamed the Clinton campaign for not doing more to prevent Russian interference.[228] He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign.[229] Politico noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a political action committee (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.[229] In November 2018, the Sanders Institute and Yanis Varoufakis, co-founder of DiEM25, launched Progressive International, an international organization uniting progressive activists and organizations \"to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it\".[230][231][232] A variety of analysts have suggested that Sanders's campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic party politically leftward. A new political organization, Brand New Congress, was formed in April 2016 by former campaign staffers. It works to elect congressional representatives with platforms in line with Sanders's.[233] In August 2016, he formed Our Revolution, a political organization dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates for local, state, and national office.[234][235] Speaking on the PBS Newshour about the upcoming 2018 elections and discussing the main principles of the two major parties, Susan Page described the Republican party as \"Trump's party\" and the Democratic party as \"Bernie Sanders's party\", saying that \"Sanders and his more progressive stance has really taken hold.\"[236] Noting the increasing acceptance of his national single-payer health-care program, his $15-an-hour minimum wage stance, free college tuition and many of the other campaign platform issues he introduced, an April 2018 opinion article in The Week suggested, \"Quietly but steadily, the Democratic Party is admitting that Sanders was right.\"[237] In July 2016 a Slate article called the Democratic platform draft \"a monument to his campaign\", noting not only his call for a $15 minimum wage, but other campaign issues, such as Social Security expansion, a carbon tax, Wall Street reform, opposition to the death penalty, and a \"reasoned pathway for future legalization\" of marijuana.[238] On February 19, 2019, Sanders announced on Vermont Public Radio that he would seek the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election.[239] On the same day, he announced his campaign in an interview with John Dickerson on CBS This Morning[240] and in an email to his supporters.[241] He had declined the Vermont Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018, which caused an unsuccessful legal challenge to his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Along with his 2019 campaign announcement, he said he would abide by a new Democratic Party rule for presidential candidates and that he would affirm his membership in that party.[242] On March 5, 2019, he signed a formal statement, known as a \"loyalty pledge,\" that he is a member of the Democratic Party and will serve as a Democrat if elected. News reports noted that, the day before, he had signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to his Senate seat in 2024.[1] Sanders's campaign manager is Faiz Shakir. The campaign's national co-chairs are Ben & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen, Representative Ro Khanna, Our Revolution President Nina Turner, and San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz.[243][244] Given the high national profile that Sanders has maintained since his 2016 campaign, NPR described him as \"no longer an underdog\" when he announced his 2020 campaign.[245] Nevertheless, his campaign has employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a Super PAC and relying predominantly on individual, small-dollar contributions. As of August 2019, The New York Times estimated that his campaign had brought in $46 per donor, compared to $80 per donor for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who have pursued fundraising methods focused on wealthier donors.[246] According to Federal Election Commission filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money of the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races.[247][248][249] In the second quarter of 2018, his campaign raised $18 million and transferred an additional $6 million from existing accounts, giving him the most cash on hand ($27 million) in the Democratic primary field. But he was outraised in the second quarter by Pete Buttigieg ($24 million), Joe Biden ($22 million), and Elizabeth Warren ($19 million).[250] In September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million individual donors.[251] On October 1, 2019, the campaign announced it had raised $25.3 million in the year's third quarter, with an average donation of $18. It was the largest quarterly sum raised by any Democratic candidate. He also transferred another $2.6 million from other accounts to his presidential campaign.[252][253] The campaign raised $34.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.[254] The Sanders campaign has used the internet and social media as key tools in its organizing efforts. Using the large email list it built during the 2016 campaign, the 2020 campaign recruited more than one million volunteers within weeks of its launch. It enlisted several former NowThis News employees to produce professional videos for wide social media distribution, has live-streamed various forums to its millions of social media followers, and has launched a podcast and smartphone app for grassroots organizing.[255] Sanders steadily polled between 15-20% on most national surveys between May and September 2019, according to the RealClearPolitics average. This placed him in a decisive second-place behind Joe Biden until Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris caught up in July. As of September, Harris's support had dipped back into the single digits, while Warren and Sanders remained in a virtual tie for second place. Some surveys showed Warren ahead of him, while others showed the reverse.[256] National surveys of a potential general election matchup with Donald Trump showed Sanders leading by an average of 6.5% as of September 2019, compared to a 11.7% lead for Biden and a 5% lead for Warren.[257] The average of polls in New Hampshire in August and September 2019 showed a virtual tie between candidates Sanders, Warren, and Biden.[258] According to a RealClearPolitics analysis, Sanders received the third-most most mentions on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC between January and August 2019, trailing only Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden, however, received twice as many mentions as Sanders and Harris. Mentions of Sanders on ABC World News Tonight found him in second place, though also trailing Biden by a large margin. Online mentions \"reflect a slightly more balanced picture,\" with both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren running \"neck-and-neck\" with Biden.[259] During the first three Democratic primary debates, Sanders appeared near the center stage, as one of the highest polling candidates. During the July and September debates, he and Elizabeth Warren were described by commentators as having a \"non-aggression pact\", staking out similar progressive positions in contrast to the more centrist candidates.[260][261] On April 6, 2019, Sanders participated in a Fox News town hall that attracted more than 2.55 million viewers.[262][263] His decision to appear on Fox was controversial given the Democratic National Committee's decision not to allow Fox to host any of its debates, and he was criticized by surrogates of Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke and Joe Biden for appearing on the network.[264][265] His appearance on Fox News saw an increase of Fox News viewers by 24% overall and 40% in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, surpassing the ratings of all prior 2020 Democratic presidential candidate town halls. As of September 2019, the town hall has also received more than 1.5 million views on YouTube.[266] On August 6, Sanders appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Some praised Rogan for \"hosting a pragmatic discussion\" while others \"seemed rather stunned by Sanders' decision to appear on the show at all.\" Following the podcast Rogan became a top-trending Twitter topic.[267] Rogan has been criticized by some progressives for interviewing people associated with the alt right, such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones. After interviewing him, Rogan said, \"I am not right-wing\u00a0... I've interviewed right-wing people. I am 100% left-wing\u00a0... Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I would 100% vote for him. Tulsi Gabbard is my favorite.\"[268] As of October 2019, the podcast had received more than 10 million views on YouTube.[269] Sanders took part in the October 15 Democratic debate, his first appearance since his heart attack. Nationally recognized debate coach Todd Graham gave Sanders's performance an A, his highest rating of all the candidates, writing, \"when Joe Biden said, 'I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done' Sanders was ready to put things in perspective by replying, 'You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement) and PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations), with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.'\" Graham gave both Biden and Elizabeth Warren a C.[270] On October 1, 2019, Sanders was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas. His campaign announced the next day that a blockage was found in one coronary artery and two stents were inserted.[271] Scheduled campaign events and appearances were canceled until further notice.[272] Two days later his campaign released a statement saying that he had been diagnosed with a heart attack. He was released from the hospital the same day.[271] The statement included the following from Sanders' doctors:[273] After presenting to an outside facility with chest pain, Sen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. He was immediately transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. The senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion. All other arteries were normal. His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.A few days after returning home, Sanders addressed media outside his home and said he had experienced fatigue and chest discomfort for a month or two before the incident; he expressed regret for not seeking medical assessment sooner: \"I was dumb\".[274] Sanders made his first national appearance following his heart attack on October 15 at the Democratic debate, at which he said, \"I'm healthy, I'm feeling great.\" When asked how he would reassure voters about his health and ability to take on the duties of the presidency, he said, \"We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.\" It was noted that he was \"lively and sharp at the debate.\"[275] In December 2019, three months after experiencing a heart attack, Sanders released letters from three physicians - Attending Physician of Congress Brian P. Monahan and two cardiologists - who declared Sanders as healthy and recovered from his heart condition.[276] Progressive Era Repression and persecution Anti-war and civil rights movements Contemporary Sanders is a self-described \"democratic socialist\",[277] and progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy and has been a proponent of workplace democracy.[278] He advocates for universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, as well as tuition-free tertiary education.\"[279] He supports lowering the cost of drugs by reforming patent laws to allow cheaper generic versions to be sold in the U.S.[280] He supported the Affordable Care Act, though he said it did not go far enough.[281] In November 2015, he gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including its place in the policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.[282][283] In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: \"I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad.\"[282] Based on his positions and votes throughout his political career, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as \"a New Dealer\".[c][284] Other observers, such as Lane Kenworthy and Bhaskar Sunkara, suggest that his views are more closely related to those of social democrats.[285][286] Sanders views global warming as a serious problem,[287] and advocates bold action to reverse its effects. He calls for substantial investment in infrastructure, with \"energy efficiency and sustainability\" and job creation as prominent goals.[288][289] He considers climate change the greatest threat to national security.[290][287] He said that family planning can help fight climate change.[291] He opposed the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the grounds that, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, it \"will have a significant impact on our climate.\"[292] In 2019, he announced his support for Green New Deal legislation,[293] and joined Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Earl Blumenauer in proposing legislation that would declare climate change a national and international emergency.[294] Sanders focuses on economic issues such as income and wealth inequality,[295][296] poverty,[297] raising the minimum wage,[149] universal healthcare,[279] cancelling all student debt,[298] making public colleges and universities tuition-free by taxing financial transactions,[299] and expanding Social Security benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll tax on all incomes above $250,000.[300][301] He has become a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers parental leave, sick leave, and vacation time, noting that such laws have been adopted by nearly all other developed countries.[302] He also supports legislation that would make it easier for workers to join or form a trade union.[303][304] He was against the bank bailout,[305] and has called for comprehensive financial reforms,[306] such as breaking up \"too big to fail\" financial institutions, restoring Glass\u2013Steagall legislation, reforming the Federal Reserve Bank, and allowing the Post Office to offer basic financial services in economically marginalized communities.[307][308][309][310] Believing greater emphasis is needed on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements, Sanders voted against and has long spoken against NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China. He has called them a \"disaster for the American worker\", saying that they have resulted in American corporations moving abroad. He also strongly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he says was \"written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street.\"[311][312] On May 1, 2019, he tweeted: \"Since the China trade deal I voted against, America has lost over three million manufacturing jobs. It's wrong to pretend that China isn't one of our major economic competitors.\"[313] On foreign policy, Sanders broadly supports reducing military spending, pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation. He opposed funding Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, in the CIA's covert war against Nicaragua's leftist government.[314] He strongly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has criticized a number of policies instituted during the War on Terror, particularly that of mass surveillance and the USA Patriot Act.[315][316][317] He criticized Israel's bellicose actions during the 2014 Gaza war[318] and U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.[319] On November 15, 2015, in response to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s attacks in Paris, He cautioned against \"Islamophobia\" and said, \"We gotta be tough, not stupid\" in the war against ISIL, adding that the U.S. should continue to welcome Syrian refugees.[320] He criticized the January 2020 drone assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, calling it a dangerous escalation of tensions that could lead to an expensive war.[321] Addressing Westminster College in a September 2017 speech, Sanders laid out a \"progressive foreign policy\" that pushes for greater international collaboration, an adherence to U.S.-led international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal framework, and the promotion of human rights and democratic ideals. He emphasized the evils associated with \"outrageous\" global economic inequality and climate change, and urged reining in the use of U.S. military power, saying it \"must always be a last resort\". He also heavily criticized U.S. support for \"murderous regimes\" during the Cold War, such as those in Iran, Chile and El Salvador, and said that those actions continue to make the U.S. less safe.[322][323] He also spoke critically of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and the way President Trump has handled the crisis.[324] He condemned the Turkish military offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria, saying that Turkey is \"not a U.S. ally\".[325] Sanders supports banning assault weapons, universal federal background checks for gun purchases, and closing the gun show loophole.[326][327][328] In 1990, he was supported by the NRA in his bid to become a U.S. Representative in exchange for opposing both the competing campaign of Peter Smith, who had reversed his stance on firearm restrictions, and waiting periods for handgun purchases.[329] In 1993, while a U.S. Representative, he voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (which established background checks and wait periods), and in 2005 he voted for legislation that gave gun manufacturers legal immunity against claims of negligence, but as of 2016[update] he has since said that he would support repealing that law.[98] In 1996, he voted against additional funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for research on issues related to firearms; but then in 2016, he called for an increase in CDC funding for the study of gun violence.[98] On social issues, Sanders has long taken liberal stances.[330] He advocated for LGBT rights as Burlington mayor in 1983 and voted against the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. In 2006, he indicated that the time was not right for legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont, describing the issue as properly handled at the state, not the national, level; but then in 2009, he supported the legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont, which was enacted that year.[331] He considers himself a feminist,[332] is pro-choice on abortion, and opposes the de-funding of Planned Parenthood.[333] He has denounced institutional racism and called for criminal justice reform to reduce the number of people in prison,[334] advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports abolishing private, for-profit prisons[335][336][337] and the death penalty.[338] He supports Black Lives Matter.[339] He also supports legalizing marijuana at the federal level.[340] He has advocated for greater democratic participation by citizens, campaign finance reform, and a constitutional amendment or judicial decision that would overturn Citizens United v. FEC.[341][342][343] Sanders criticized President Trump for appointing multiple billionaires to his cabinet.[344] He criticized Trump's rolling back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, noting the scientifically reported effect on climate change of human activity and citing Trump's calling those reports a hoax.[345] He called for caution on the Syrian Civil War, saying, \"it's easier to get into a war than out of one.\"[346] He has promised to defeat \"Trump and Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology\".[347] Sanders condemned Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, because \"It would dramatically undermine the prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage the United States' ability to broker that peace.\"[348] He gave an online reply to Trump's January 2018 State of the Union address, where he called Trump \"compulsively dishonest\" and criticized him for initiating \"a looming immigration crisis\" by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He voiced concern about Trump's failure to mention the finding that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and \"will likely interfere in the 2018 midterms we will be holding\u00a0... Unless you have a very special relationship with Mr. Putin.\"[349] Born into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956.[350] Although elected mayor of Burlington as an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that \"if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite\"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically.[351] The Washington Post reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.[351][41] Once elected to the House of Representatives, Sanders joined the Democratic caucus, although some conservative southern Democrats initially barred him from the caucus as they believed that allowing a self-described socialist to join would harm their electoral prospects.[41] He soon came to work constructively with Democrats, voting with the party over 90% of the time during his tenure in the House and in the Senate.[41] Starting in November 2015, in connection with his presidential campaign, Sanders's announcements suggested that not only was he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections.[352][353][354] When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, \"Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination.\"[355] Since he remained a Senator elected as an independent, the United States Senate website continued to refer to him as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate.[356] He confirmed at the end of the campaign that he remained an independent in the Senate for the balance of his term since that was how he was elected.[357] Sanders advocated that, following Trump's victory in the 2016 elections, the Democratic Party undergo a \"series of reforms\" and that it had to \"break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor.\"[358] He drew parallels between his campaign and that of the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election.[359][360] He wrote in The New York Times that \"the British elections should be a lesson for the Democratic Party\" and urged the Democrats to stop holding on to an \"overly cautious, centrist ideology\", arguing that \"momentum shifted to Labour after it released a very progressive manifesto that generated much enthusiasm among young people and workers\".[361][362] He had earlier praised Jeremy Corbyn's stance on class issues.[363] In October 2017, Sanders said he would run for reelection as an independent in 2018 though he was pressured to run as a Democrat.[364] He joined Vermont's Liberty Union Party in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman,[53] but quit in 1977 to become an independent.[365] In 1980 he served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party.[366] In 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent. He would later be reelected three times.[367] He first ran for the US House of Representatives in 1988 and for the US Senate in 2006, each time adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election.[368] He continued this strategy through his reelection in the 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont.[369] Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent. He caucused with the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the House[12] while refusing to join the Democratic caucus or party,[78] and caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate.[165] Sanders's campaigns for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination have created some controversy about his affiliation. On the 2016 campaign trail, he affirmed that he was a Democrat running for the Democratic nomination.[355] But both his Senate website and press materials continued to label him as an \"independent\" during and after the campaign.[356][357] His party status became ambiguous once again in March 2019 when he signed a formal \"loyalty pledge\" to the Democratic Party stating that he is a member of the party and will serve as a Democrat if elected president. He signed the pledge the day after he signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to the Senate in 2024.[1] Commentators have noted the consistency of Sanders's views throughout his political career.[370][371] Many have examined his political platform and variety of democratic socialism and found it to be based on tax-funded social benefits rather than social ownership of the means of production. Commentators have variously described Sanders's political philosophy as \"welfarism\"[372] or \"social democracy\"[373] but not democratic socialism as defined as \"an attempt to create a property-free, socialist society\".[374] Some members of various US socialist parties and organizations have said that Sanders is a reformer of capitalism, not a socialist.[375][376][377] Others distinguish among socialism, social democracy, and democratic socialism, and describe his philosophy as an extension of such existing liberal programs in the US as Social Security and Medicare[378][379][284] and more consistent with the social democracy found in much of Europe, especially the Nordic countries.[380][381] Before his 2016 presidential run, Sanders was known as a legislator who advocated for progressive causes but \"rarely forged actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.\"[382] According to The New York Times, \"Big legislation largely eludes Mr. Sanders because his ideas are usually far to the left of the majority of the Senate\u00a0... Mr. Sanders has largely found ways to press his agenda through appending small provisions to the larger bills of others.\"[383] During his time in the Senate, he had lower \"legislative effectiveness\" than the average senator, as measured by the number of sponsored bills that passed and successful amendments made.[384] In 1963, Sanders and Deborah Shiling Messing, whom he met in college, volunteered for several months on the Israeli kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim. They married in 1964 and bought a summer home in Vermont; they had no children and divorced in 1966.[27][385][386][387] His son (and only biological child), Levi Sanders, was born in 1969 to girlfriend Susan Campbell Mott.[25] In 1988, Sanders married Jane O'Meara Driscoll (n\u00e9e\u00a0Mary Jane O'Meara), who later became president of Burlington College, in Burlington, Vermont.[388] The day after their wedding, the couple visited the Soviet Union as part of an official delegation in his capacity as mayor.[389][390] He considers Jane's three children\u2014Dave Driscoll (born 1975), Carina Driscoll (born 1974), and Heather Titus (n\u00e9e\u00a0Driscoll; 1971)\u2014to be his own.[27][391] He also has seven grandchildren,[392] three (including one who was adopted) through his son Levi and four through his stepchildren.[393] In December 1987, during his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Sanders recorded a folk album, We Shall Overcome, with 30 Vermont musicians. As he was not a skilled singer, he performed his vocals in a talking blues style.[394][395] He appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy-drama film Sweet Hearts Dance, playing a man who distributes candy to young trick-or-treaters.[396] In 1999, he acted in the film My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception, playing Rabbi Manny Shevitz. In this role he mourned the Brooklyn Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, reflecting Sanders's own upbringing in Brooklyn.[397] On February 6, 2016, he was a guest star alongside Larry David on Saturday Night Live, playing a Polish immigrant on a steamship that was sinking near the Statue of Liberty.[398] On December 4, 2015, Sanders won Time's 2015 Person of the Year readers' poll with 10.2% of the vote[399][400] but did not receive the editorial board's award. On March 20, 2016, he was given an honorary Coast Salish name, dx\u02b7shudi\u010dup,[d] by Deborah Parker in Seattle to honor his focus on Native American issues during his presidential campaign.[401] Sanders's elder brother, Larry, lives in England;[402] he was a Green Party county councillor, representing the East Oxford division on Oxfordshire County Council, until he retired from the Council in 2013.[403][404] Larry ran as a Green Party candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon in the 2015 British general election and came in fifth.[405][406] Sanders told CNN, \"I owe my brother an enormous amount. It was my brother who actually introduced me to a lot of my ideas.\"[406] On May 30, 2017, Sanders received an Honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Brooklyn College.[407] After complaints made in 2016 by Donald Trump's Vermont campaign chairman, the FBI launched an investigation into his wife Jane's involvement in a bank loan for Burlington College when she was its president.[408][409][410][411] The Washington Post reported on June 25, 2017, that Sanders himself was not under FBI investigation.[412] Both he and his wife retained prominent counsel during the investigation.[410][411] In November 2018, the U.S. Attorney for Vermont informed Jane that the investigation had ended and that no charges would be filed.[413] In 2016 and 2017, Sanders reported earnings of just over $1\u00a0million, mostly royalties and advances on the books he had published those years.[414][415] He and his wife own a row house in Capitol Hill, a house in Burlington's New North End neighborhood, and a lakefront summer home in North Hero.[416][417][418][419] As Sanders described his upbringing as an American Jew in a 2016 speech: his father generally attended synagogue only on Yom Kippur; he attended public schools while his mother \"chafed\" at his yeshiva Sunday schooling at a Hebrew school; and their religious observances were mostly limited to Passover seders with their neighbors. Larry Sanders said of their parents, \"They were very pleased to be Jews, but didn't have a strong belief in God.\"[420] Bernie had a bar mitzvah[421] at the historic Kingsway Jewish Center in Midwood, Brooklyn, where he grew up.[420] In 1963, in cooperation with the Labor Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair, Sanders and his first wife volunteered at Sha'ar HaAmakim, a kibbutz in northern Israel.[422][423][424][425] His motivation for the trip was as much socialistic as it was Zionistic.[420] As mayor of Burlington, Sanders allowed a Chabad public menorah to be placed at city hall, an action the ACLU contested. He publicly inaugurated the Hanukkah menorah and performed the Jewish religious ritual of blessing Hanukkah candles.[420] His early and strong support played a significant role in the now widespread public menorah celebrations around the globe.[426][427][428][429] When asked about his Jewish heritage, Sanders has said that he is \"proud to be Jewish\".[425] Sanders rarely speaks about religion.[421] He describes himself as \"not particularly religious\"[425] and \"not actively involved\" with organized religion.[421] A press package issued by his office states \"Religion: Jewish\".[430] He has said he believes in God, but not necessarily in a traditional manner: \"I think everyone believes in God in their own ways,\" he said. \"To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.\"[421][431] In October 2015, on the late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel asked him, \"You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you believe in God and do you think that's important to the people of the United States?\" Sanders replied:[432] I am who I am, and what I believe in and what my spirituality is about is that we're all in this together. That I think it is not a good thing to believe as human beings we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people\u00a0... and this is not Judaism, this is what Pope Francis is talking about, that we can't just worship billionaires and the making of more and more money. Life is more than that. In 2016, he disclosed that he had \"very strong religious and spiritual feelings\", adding, \"My spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.\"[433] Sanders does not regularly attend synagogue, and he works on Rosh Hashanah, a day Jews typically do not work. He has attended yahrzeit observances in memory of the deceased, for the father of a friend, and in 2015 attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.[420] According to his close friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, Sanders's Jewish identity is \"certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious\".[434] Deborah Dash Moore, a Judaic scholar at the University of Michigan, has said that Sanders has a particular type of \"ethnic Jewishness\" that is somewhat old-fashioned.[435] His wife is Roman Catholic, and he has frequently expressed admiration for Pope Francis, saying that \"the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound issues. It is important that we listen to what he has said.\" He has said he feels \"very close\" to Francis's economic teachings, describing him as \"incredibly smart and brave\".[11][436][437] In April 2016, he accepted an invitation from Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, an aide close to Francis, to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues. While at the Vatican, he met briefly with Francis.[438][439] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

The U.S. Representative for the state's at-large congressional district from 1991 to 2007, he is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history and a member of the Democratic caucus. He ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president and is running again in 2020.\nA progressive and self-described democratic socialist, Sanders is known for his opposition to economic inequality. On domestic policy, he broadly supports labor rights, and has supported universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, tuition-free tertiary education, and an ambitious Green New Deal to create jobs addressing climate change. On foreign policy, he broadly supports reducing military spending, pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation, and putting greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements. Commentators have variously described his political philosophy as aligned with New Deal policies and social democracy, but not necessarily with true socialism\u2014characterized by the social ownership of the means of production\u2014and have noted the strong influence his views have had on Democratic Party politics since his 2016 presidential campaign.[2][3][4]\nSanders was born into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. He attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was an active protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality as well as for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. As an independent, he was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 and reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district; he later co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as a U.S. Representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006; he was reelected to the Senate in 2012 and 2018.\nIn April 2015, Sanders announced his campaign for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Despite initially low expectations, he went on to win 23 primaries and caucuses and approximately 43% of pledged delegates, to Hillary Clinton's 55%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for his rejection of large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. In July 2016, he formally endorsed Clinton in her general election bid against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the \"political revolution\" his campaign had begun. In February 2019, he announced a second presidential campaign, joining a large field of Democratic candidates pursuing the party nomination.\nSanders was born on September 8, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York City.[5] His father, Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders (1904\u20131962),[6] was born in S\u0142opnice, Galicia, in Austria-Hungary (now part of Poland),[7][8] to a Jewish family. In 1921, Elias immigrated to the United States, where he became a paint salesman.[7][9][10] His mother, Dorothy Sanders (n\u00e9e\u00a0Glassberg, 1912\u20131960), was born in New York City[11][12] to Jewish immigrant parents from Poland and Russia.[13][14]\nSanders became interested in politics at an early age: \"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932. He won an election, and 50 million people died as a result of that election in World War II, including six million Jews. So what I learned as a little kid is that politics is, in fact, very important.\"[b][17] In the 1940s, many of his relatives in German-occupied Poland were murdered in the Holocaust.[18]\nSanders lived in Midwood, Brooklyn.[19] He attended elementary school at P.S. 197 in Brooklyn, where he won a borough championship on the basketball team.[20][21] He attended Hebrew school in the afternoons, and celebrated his bar mitzvah in 1954.[22] His older brother, Larry, said that during their childhood, the family never lacked for food or clothing, but major purchases, \"like curtains or a rug\", were not affordable.[23]\nSanders attended James Madison High School, also in Brooklyn, where he was captain of the track team and took third place in the New York City indoor one-mile race.[20] In high school, he lost his first election, finishing last out of three candidates for the student body presidency. Not long after his high school graduation, his mother died at the age of 46.[12][22] His father died a few years later on August 4, 1962, at the age of 57.[8]\nSanders studied at Brooklyn College for a year in 1959\u20131960[24] before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in political science in 1964.[24] He has described himself as a mediocre college student because the classroom was \"boring and irrelevant\", while the community was more important to his education.[25]\nSanders later described his time in Chicago as \"the major period of intellectual ferment in my life\".[26] While there, he joined the Young People's Socialist League (the youth affiliate of the Socialist Party of America)[27] and was active in the Civil Rights Movement as a student for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).[28][29] Under his chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of the SNCC.[30] In January 1962, he went to a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. \"We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,\" Sanders said at the protest. He and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president's office.[31][32] After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination.[33] Following further protests, the University of Chicago ended official racial segregation in private university housing in the summer of 1963.[26] Joan Mahoney, a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described him in a 2016 interview as \"a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn't terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn't agree with\".[34] He once spent a day putting up fliers protesting police brutality, only to eventually notice that Chicago police had shadowed him and taken them all down.[31]\nSanders attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave the \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[28][31][35] That summer, he was fined $25 (equivalent to $209 in 2019) for resisting arrest during a demonstration in Englewood against segregation in Chicago's public schools.[26][36][37]\nIn addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s,[38] Sanders was active in several peace and antiwar movements while attending the University of Chicago. He was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Student Peace Union. He applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be drafted. Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought in it, and he has long been a strong supporter of veterans' benefits.[39][40] He also was briefly an organizer with the United Packinghouse Workers of America while in Chicago.[26] He also worked on the reelection campaign of Leon Despres, a prominent Chicago alderman who was opposed to mayor Richard J. Daley's Democratic Party machine. During his student years, Sanders also read a variety of American and European political authors, from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and John Dewey to Karl Marx and Erich Fromm.[41]\nAfter graduating from college, Sanders returned to New York City, where he briefly had a variety of jobs, including Head Start teacher, psychiatric aide, and carpenter.[25] In 1968 he moved to Stannard, Vermont, a town small in both area and population (88 residents at the 1970 census) within Vermont's extremely rural \"Northeast Kingdom\" region, because he had been \"captivated by rural life\". While there he worked as a carpenter,[27] filmmaker, and writer[42] who created and sold \"radical film strips\" and other educational materials to schools.[43] He also wrote several articles for the alternative publication The Vermont Freeman.[44] He lived in the area for several years before moving to the more populous Chittenden County in the mid-1970s.\nDuring Sanders's 2018 reelection campaign, he returned to the town to hold an event with voters and other candidates on November 3, three days before the election,[45] during which he told stories of his early years living in the town, with his former residence less than a mile from the meeting hall where the event was held.[46]\nSanders began his electoral political career in 1971 as a member of the Liberty Union Party, which originated in the anti-war movement and the People's Party. He ran as the Liberty Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate for U.S. senator in 1972 and 1974.[47] In the 1974 senatorial race, he finished third (5,901 votes; 4%), behind 33-year-old Chittenden County State's Attorney Patrick Leahy (D, VI; 70,629 votes; 49%) and two-term incumbent U.S. Representative Dick Mallary (R; 66,223 votes; 46%).[48][49]\nThe 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union's influence, with Sanders collecting 11,000 votes for governor and the party. This forced the races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the Republican or Democratic candidates for those offices from garnering a majority of votes.[50] The campaign drained the finances and energy of the Liberty Union, however, and in October 1977, less than a year after the 1976 campaign concluded, he and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party.[50]\nFollowing his resignation from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, Sanders worked as a writer and as the director of the nonprofit American People's Historical Society (APHS).[51] While with the APHS, he produced a 30-minute documentary about American labor leader Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president five times for the Socialist Party.[27][52]\nIn 1980, Sanders ran for mayor of Burlington, Vermont (pop. 38,000), at the urging of his close friend and political confidant Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont. He was mayor for eight years, from April 6, 1981, to April 4, 1989.[53]\nThe 39-year-old Sanders ran against incumbent Democratic mayor Gordon \"Gordie\" Paquette, a five-term mayor who had served as a member of the Burlington City Council for 13 years before that, building extensive community ties and a willingness to cooperate with Republican leaders in controlling appointments to various commissions. Republicans had found Paquette so unobjectionable that they failed to field a candidate in the March 1981 race against him, leaving Sanders as his principal opponent. Sanders' effort was further aided by Citizens Party candidate Greg Guma's decision to exit the race so as not to split the progressive vote. Two other candidates in the race, independents Richard Bove and Joe McGrath, were non-factors in the campaign, with the battle coming down to Paquette and Sanders.[50]\nSanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders was elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as by a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The final result came as a shock to the local political establishment when Sanders won by just 10 votes.[50]\nSanders was reelected three times, defeating both Democratic and Republican candidates. He received 53% of the vote in 1983 and 55% in 1985.[54] In his final run for mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated Paul Lafayette, a Democrat endorsed by both major parties.[55] In 1986, he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Governor Madeleine Kunin (D) in her run for reelection. Running as an independent, he finished third with 14% of the vote, while Kunin won with 47%, followed by Lt. Governor Peter P. Smith (R) with 38%.\nAfter serving four two-year terms, Sanders chose not to seek reelection in 1989. He went on to lecture in political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government that year and at Hamilton College in 1991.[56]\nDuring his mayoralty, Sanders called himself a socialist and was so described in the press.[57][58] During his first term his supporters, including the first Citizens Party city councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party.[59] The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under Sanders, Burlington became the first U.S. city to fund community-trust housing.[60]\nDuring the 1980s, Sanders was a consistent critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America.[61] In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by Noam Chomsky. In his introduction, he praised Chomsky as \"a very vocal and important voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America\" and said that he was \"delighted to welcome a person who I think we're all very proud of.\"[62][63]\nSanders's administration balanced the city budget and drew a minor league baseball team, the Vermont Reds, then the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, to Burlington.[12] Under his leadership, Burlington sued the local television cable franchise, thereby winning reduced rates for customers.[12]\nAs mayor, Sanders led extensive downtown revitalization projects. One of his primary achievements was improving Burlington's Lake Champlain waterfront.[12] In 1981, he campaigned against the unpopular plans by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial[64] waterfront property owned by the Central Vermont Railway into expensive condominiums, hotels, and offices.[65] He ran under the slogan \"Burlington is not for sale\" and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the waterfront area into a mixed-use district featuring housing, parks, and public spaces.[65]\nSanders hosted and produced a public-access television program, Bernie Speaks with the Community, from 1986 to 1988.[66][67] He collaborated with 30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, We Shall Overcome, in 1987.[68][69]\nIn 1987, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Sanders one of America's best mayors.[70] As of 2013[update] Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the United States.[71][72]\nIn 1988, incumbent Republican congressman Jim Jeffords decided to run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing Vermont's at-large congressional district. Former Lieutenant Governor Peter P. Smith (R) won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic State Representative Paul N. Poirier placed third with 19%.[73] Two years later, he ran for the seat again and defeated Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.[74]\nSanders was the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Frazier Reams's election to represent Ohio 40 years earlier.[75] The Washington Post and other news media noted that it was the first election of a socialist to the United States House of Representatives in decades.[76][75]\nSanders served as a representative for 16 years, from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 Republican Revolution, when he won by 3%, with 50% of the vote.[77]\nDuring his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as working primarily on behalf of the wealthy. In 1991, he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of mostly liberal Democrats that Sanders chaired for its first eight years,[12] while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.[78]\nIn 2005, Rolling Stone called Sanders the \"amendment king\" for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control.  Sanders' position as an Independent allowed him to form coalitions across party lines.[79]\nIn 1999, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the Glass\u2013Steagall Legislation provisions that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate entities.[80] He was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion with the then-Chairman, Sanders told him he was concerned that Greenspan was \"way out of touch\" and \"that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations\".[81][82][83][84]\nConcerned by high breast cancer rates in Vermont, on February 7, 1992, Sanders sponsored the Cancer Registries Amendment Act to establish cancer registries to collect data on cancer.[85][86] Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a companion bill in the Senate on October 2, 1992. The Senate bill was passed by the House on October 6 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on October 24, 1992.[87]\nIn 1993, Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks when buying guns and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238\u2013187.[88][89] He voted against the bill four more times in the 1990s, explaining his Vermont constituents (high on hunting, low on homicide) saw waiting-period mandates as more appropriately a state than federal matter.\nSanders did vote for other gun-control measures.[90][88] For example, in 1994 he voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \"because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons\". He was nevertheless extremely critical of the other parts of the bill.[91][92] Although he acknowledged that \"clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them\", he maintained that governmental policies played a large part in \"dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence\" and argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, saying, \"we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails\".[93]\nIn 1998, Sanders voted for a bill that would have increased minimum sentencing for possession of a gun while committing a federal crime to 10 years in prison, including nonviolent crimes such as marijuana possession.[94][88][95]\nIn 2005, Sanders voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.[96] The act's purpose was to prevent firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products.[97] As of 2016[update] he said that he has since changed his position and would vote for legislation to defeat this bill.[98]\nSanders was a consistent critic of the Patriot Act.[99] As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation.[100] After its 357\u201366 passage in the House, he sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects[101] and voted against each reauthorization.[102] In June 2005, he proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November\u00a04 of that year in House\u2013Senate negotiations and never became law.[103]\nSanders voted against the resolutions authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists[104] that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks.[105] He voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the George W. Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the investigation of what turned out to be a leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department official, he stated: \"The revelation that the President authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is now for a serious investigation of how we got into the war in Iraq and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President.\"[106]\nIn 1996, Sanders voted against a bill that would have prohibited the purchasing of tanks and armored carriers by police.[94][107]\nOn November 2, 2005, Sanders voted against the Online Freedom of Speech Act, which would have exempted the Internet from the campaign finance restrictions of the McCain\u2013Feingold Bill.[108]\nSanders entered the race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, after Senator Jim Jeffords announced that he would not seek a fourth term. Chuck Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, endorsed Sanders, a critical move as it meant that no Democrat running against him could expect to receive financial help from the party. He was also endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Democratic National Committee chairman and former Vermont governor Howard Dean. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who \"votes with the Democrats 98% of the time.\"[109] Then-Senator Barack Obama also campaigned for him in Vermont in March 2006.[110] Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did.[111][112]\nIn the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history,[113] he defeated businessman Rich Tarrant by an approximately 2-to-1 margin. Many national media outlets projected Sanders as the winner just after the polls closed, before any returns came in. He was reelected in 2012 with 71% of the vote,[114] and in 2018 with 67% of the vote.[115]\nWhile a member of Congress, Sanders sponsored 15 concurrent resolutions and 15 Senate resolutions,[116] two of which passed, expressing the Senate's views on policy or commemorative questions.[117] Of the bills he sponsored two became law, including Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013 and of those he co-sponsored, 218 became law.[118][119]  He has sponsored over 500 amendments to bills,[120] many of which became law. The results of these amendments include a ban on imported goods made by child labor; $100 million in funding for community health centers in 2002; $10 million for an outreach program for servicemembers suffering from PTSD, traumatic brain injury, depression, panic attacks, etc.; a public database of senior Department of Defense officials seeking employment with defense contractors; and inclusion of autism treatment in the military healthcare program.[121]\nIn 2008 and 2009, Sanders voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP, also known as the Wall Street bailout), a program to purchase toxic banking assets and provide loans to banks that were in free-fall.[122][123] On February 4, 2009, he sponsored an amendment to ensure that TARP funds would not displace US workers. The amendment passed and was added to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[121][124] Among his proposed financial reforms is the auditing of the Federal Reserve, which would reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve in monetary policy deliberations; Federal Reserve officials say that \"Audit the Fed\" legislation would expose the Federal Reserve to undue political pressure from lawmakers who do not like its decisions.[125][126][127]\n\nOn December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an \u200b8\u00a01\u20442\u2013hour speech against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, the proposed extension of the Bush-era tax rates that eventually became law, arguing that the legislation would favor the wealthiest Americans. \"Enough is enough!\u00a0... How many homes can you own?\" he asked.[128][129][130] A long speech such as this is commonly known as a filibuster, but because it did not block action, it was not technically a filibuster under Senate rules.[131]\nIn response to the speech, hundreds of people signed online petitions urging Sanders to run in the 2012 presidential election, and pollsters began measuring his support in key primary states.[132] Progressive activists such as Rabbi Michael Lerner and economist David Korten publicly voiced their support for a prospective Sanders run against President Obama.[132] His speech was published in February 2011 by Nation Books as The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class, with authorial proceeds going to Vermont nonprofit charitable organizations.[133]\nIn 2016, Sanders voted for the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, which included proposals for a reformed audit of the Federal Reserve System.[125][126][127]\nOn June 12, 2017, U.S. senators reached an agreement on legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia and Iran.[134] The bill was opposed only by Sanders and Republican Rand Paul.[135] He supported the sanctions on Russia, but voted against the bill because he believed the sanctions could endanger the Iran nuclear deal.[136]\nIn 2018, Sanders sponsored a bill and was joined by Senators Chris Murphy (D\u2013CT) and Mike Lee (R\u2013UT) to invoke the 1973 War Powers Resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen,[137] which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties[138] and \"millions more suffering from starvation and disease\".[139][140] After the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 (which, according to multiple intelligence agencies, was ordered by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman),[141] His bill attracted bipartisan co-sponsors and support, and the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 56\u201341.[142][137][138][139][141] [137] The bill passed the House in February 2019 by a 247-175 vote and President Trump vetoed it in March, saying, \u201cThis resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.\"[143]\nIn mid-December 2009, Sanders successfully added a provision to the Affordable Care Act to fund $11 billion to community health centers, especially those in rural areas. The provision brought together Democrats on the left with Democrats from conservative, rural areas, helping to secure the 60 votes needed for passage.[121] On May 4, 2017, in response to the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, he predicted \"thousands of Americans would die\" from no longer having access to health care.[144] PolitiFact rated his statement \"mostly true\".[145]\nIn September 2017, Sanders along with 15 Senate co-sponsors submitted the Medicare for All bill, a single-payer health care plan. The bill covers vision and dental care, unlike Medicare. Some Republicans have called the bill \"Berniecare\" and \"the latest Democratic push for socialized medicine and higher taxes.\" He responded that the Republican party has no credibility on the issue of health care after voting for legislation that would take health insurance away from 32 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act]].[146]\nAs chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, Sanders has introduced legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Older Americans Act, which supports Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors.[147]\nIn 2007, Sanders helped kill a bill introducing comprehensive immigration reform, arguing that its guest-worker program would depress wages for American workers.[148] In 2010, he supported the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as minors.[148] In 2013, he supported the Gang of Eight's comprehensive immigration reform bill after advocating for the provision of a $1.5 billion youth jobs program, which he argued would offset the harm of labor market competition with immigrants.[148]\nIn April 2017, Sanders introduced a bill that would raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $15 an hour, an increase over an earlier Democratic $12/hour proposal.[149] On May 9, 2018, he introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, a bill that would expand labor rights by making it easier for workers to join a union, ban right-to-work laws and some anti-union provisions of the Taft Hartley Act, and outlaw some union-busting tactics. Announcing the legislation, he said, \"If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.\"[150]\nSanders opposed the 2018 United States federal budget proposed by the Trump administration, calling it \"a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country\u00a0... nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%\".[151]\nFollowing the November 2017 revelations from the Paradise Papers and a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies which says just three people, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett, own more wealth than the bottom half of the U.S. population, Sanders stated that \"we must end global oligarchy\" and that \"we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent.\"[152]\nOn September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with Ro Khanna to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, rather than shifting the burden onto taxpayers.[153][154]\nOn June 9, 2014, Sanders sponsored the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs in the wake of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014. He worked with Senator John McCain, who co-sponsored the bill.[155][156] His bill was incorporated into the House version of the bill, which passed both chambers on July 31, 2014, and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on August 7, 2014.[157]\nOn March 17, 2016, Sanders said he would support Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, though he added, \"there are some more progressive judges out there.\"[158] He opposed Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Court, saying that Gorsuch had \"refused to answer legitimate questions.\"[159] He also objected to the possibility of Senate Republicans using the nuclear option to \"choke off debate and ram the nomination through the Senate.\"[159] He voted against Gorsuch's confirmation as an associate justice.[160]\nSenators participate in committees that are responsible for certain types of legislation and in caucuses that build a legislative constituency for shaping legislation of interest to its members.\nAs an independent, Sanders worked out a deal with the Senate Democratic leadership in which he agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless the Democratic whip, Dick Durbin, agreed that he need not (a request rarely made or granted). In return he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013\u201314 he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (during the Veterans Health Administration scandal).[161][162]\nSanders became the ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee in January 2015; he had previously chaired the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for two years. Since January 2017 he has been Chair of the Senate Democratic Outreach Committee.[162] He appointed economics professor Stephanie Kelton, a modern monetary theory scholar, as the chief economic adviser for the committee's Democratic minority and presented a report aimed at helping \"rebuild the disappearing middle class\", which included proposals to raise the minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, and increase Social Security payments.[163]\nAccording to his senate website, Sanders's other committee assignments during 2016 were as follows:[164]\nSanders was only the third senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51\u201349 majority in the Senate during the 110th Congress in 2007\u201308. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would likely have broken any tie in favor of the Republicans.[165] He is a member of the following caucuses:\nPolling conducted in August 2011 by Public Policy Polling found that Sanders's approval rating was 67% and his disapproval rating 28%, making him then the third-most popular U.S. senator.[167] Both the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and the NHLA (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) have given him 100% voting scores during his tenure in the Senate.[168] In 2015, he was named one of the Top\u00a05 of The Forward 50.[169] In a November 2015 Morning Consult poll, he reached an approval rating of 83% among his constituents, making him the most popular U.S. senator.[170] Fox News found him to have the highest net favorability at +28 points of any prominent politician included in its March 2017 poll.[171] He ranked third in 2014 and first in both 2015 and 2016.[170][167][172]\nIn April 2017, a nationwide Harvard-Harris Poll found that Sanders had the highest favorability rating among the political figures included in the poll,[173] a standing confirmed by subsequent polling.[174]\nIn November 2013 Sanders suggested that Senator Elizabeth Warren could be president and that she might earn his backing if she ran. He added that if no progressive candidate ran, he might feel compelled to do so himself.[175][176] In December 2014 Warren said she was not running.[177]\nSanders announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president on April 30, 2015,[178][179][180] and his campaign was officially launched on May 26, 2015, in Burlington.[179] In his announcement, Sanders said, \"I don't believe that the men and women who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process,\" and made this a central idea throughout his campaign.[178][179]\nWarren welcomed Sanders's entry into the race, saying, \"I'm glad to see him get out there and give his version of what leadership in this country should be,\" but never endorsed him.[181][182]\nInitially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 primaries and caucuses and approximately 46% of pledged delegates to Clinton's 54%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for his rejection of large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. Some of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails leaked to the public in June and July 2016 showed that the committee leadership had favored Clinton over him and had worked to help Clinton win the nomination.[183]\nOn July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton in her unsuccessful general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the \"political revolution\" his campaign had begun.[184]\nUnlike the other major candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a Super PAC or by wealthy donors, instead focusing on small individual donations.[185] His presidential campaign raised $1.5\u00a0million within 24 hours of his official announcement.[186] At year's end the campaign had raised a total of $73\u00a0million from more than one million people making 2.5\u00a0million donations, with an average donation of $27.16.[187] The campaign reached 3.25\u00a0million donations by the end of January 2016, raising $20\u00a0million in that month alone.[188]\nSanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum,[189] posting content to online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and answering questions on Reddit. He gained a large grassroots organizational following online. A July 29, 2015 meetup organized online brought 100,000 supporters to more than 3,500 simultaneous events nationwide.[190]\nSanders's June 2015 campaign events drew overflow crowds around the country, to his surprise.[191][192][193] When Hillary Clinton and Sanders made public appearances within days of each other in Des Moines, Iowa, he drew larger crowds, even though he had already made numerous stops around the state and Clinton's visit was her first in 2015.[194] On July 1, 2015, his campaign stop in Madison, Wisconsin, drew the largest crowd of any 2016 presidential candidate to that date, with an estimated turnout of 10,000.[195][196] Over the following weeks, he drew even larger crowds: 11,000 in Arizona,[197] 15,000 in Seattle,[198] and 28,000 in Portland, Oregon.[199]\nThe 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates pitted candidates in the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for the President of the United States. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary Clinton.[200] In February 2016 Clinton's and Sanders's campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten.[201] Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just before the California primary, citing a need to devote her time to making direct contact with California voters and preparing for the general election.[202] He expressed his disappointment that Clinton should cancel the debate \"before the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process\".[203]\nSome supporters raised concerns that publications such as The New York Times minimized coverage of the Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates, especially Trump and Clinton. The Times's ombudsman reviewed her paper's coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that as of September\u00a02015[update] the Times \"hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.\" She also found that the Times's coverage of his campaign was much scanter than its coverage of Trump's, though Trump's was also initially considered a long shot at that time, with 63 articles covering the Trump campaign and 14 covering Sanders's.[204][205] A December 2015 report found that the three major networks\u2014CBS, NBC, and ABC\u2014had spent 234\u00a0minutes reporting on Trump and 10\u00a0minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that ABC World News Tonight had spent 81\u00a0minutes on Trump and less than one\u00a0minute on Sanders during 2015.[206]\nAmy Goodman of Democracy Now! noted that on March 15, Super Tuesday III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz were broadcast in full. Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona, on that date, speaking to a rally larger than any of the others, yet his speech was not mentioned, let alone broadcast.[207]\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted in May 2016 found Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in a \"dead heat\", but the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump.[208] Clinton and Trump were the least popular among likely candidates in the poll's entire history, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating.[209] Polls showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but that those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders.[210]\nA 2017 analysis in Newsweek found that 12% of those who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the general election, enough to swing the election in his favor. By comparison, 25% of those who voted for Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary voted for Republican nominee John McCain in the general election.[211]\nIn July 2016, a leak of the Democratic National Committee's emails appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders.  Staff repeatedly discussed the possibility of making Sanders's irreligious tendencies a campaign issue in southern states, questioned Sanders's party loyalty, and  DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz referred to Sanders's campaign manager  as \"an ASS\" and \"a damn liar\".[212] Speaking on CNN, Sanders responded to the email leak: \"it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates \u2014 to be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\"[213]\nAfter the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee.[214] On July 12 Sanders formally endorsed Clinton,[215] and he continued to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement the progressive positions for which he had campaigned. He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, \"Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton\u00a0... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency.\"[216]\nOn November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history.[217] He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined.[218]\nIt was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states,[219] and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: California,[220] New Hampshire,[221] and Vermont.[218] In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, approximately 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.[219]\nIn November 2016, Sanders's book Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In was released; upon its release, it was number\u00a03 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[222] The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.[223] In February 2017, he began webcasting The Bernie Sanders Show on Facebook live streaming. As of April\u00a02, 2017[update], guests had included William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye. [224][225] Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.[173][226]\nIn February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election revealed that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to benefit Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton.[227] Sanders rejected the investigation's conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign.[228] Furthermore, he blamed the Clinton campaign for not doing more to prevent Russian interference.[228] He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign.[229] Politico noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a political action committee (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.[229]\nIn November 2018, the Sanders Institute and Yanis Varoufakis, co-founder of DiEM25, launched Progressive International, an international organization uniting progressive activists and organizations \"to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it\".[230][231][232]\nA variety of analysts have suggested that Sanders's campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic party politically leftward. A new political organization, Brand New Congress, was formed in April 2016 by former campaign staffers. It works to elect congressional representatives with platforms in line with Sanders's.[233] In August 2016, he formed Our Revolution, a political organization dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates for local, state, and national office.[234][235] Speaking on the PBS Newshour about the upcoming 2018 elections and discussing the main principles of the two major parties, Susan Page described the Republican party as \"Trump's party\" and the Democratic party as \"Bernie Sanders's party\", saying that \"Sanders and his more progressive stance has really taken hold.\"[236] Noting the increasing acceptance of his national single-payer health-care program, his $15-an-hour minimum wage stance, free college tuition and many of the other campaign platform issues he introduced, an April 2018 opinion article in The Week suggested, \"Quietly but steadily, the Democratic Party is admitting that Sanders was right.\"[237] In July 2016 a Slate article called the Democratic platform draft \"a monument to his campaign\", noting not only his call for a $15 minimum wage, but other campaign issues, such as Social Security expansion, a carbon tax, Wall Street reform, opposition to the death penalty, and a \"reasoned pathway for future legalization\" of marijuana.[238]\nOn February 19, 2019, Sanders announced on Vermont Public Radio that he would seek the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election.[239] On the same day, he announced his campaign in an interview with John Dickerson on CBS This Morning[240] and in an email to his supporters.[241] He had declined the Vermont Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018, which caused an unsuccessful legal challenge to his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Along with his 2019 campaign announcement, he said he would abide by a new Democratic Party rule for presidential candidates and that he would affirm his membership in that party.[242] On March 5, 2019, he signed a formal statement, known as a \"loyalty pledge,\" that he is a member of the Democratic Party and will serve as a Democrat if elected. News reports noted that, the day before, he had signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to his Senate seat in 2024.[1]\nSanders's campaign manager is Faiz Shakir. The campaign's national co-chairs are Ben &amp; Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen, Representative Ro Khanna, Our Revolution President Nina Turner, and San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz.[243][244]\nGiven the high national profile that Sanders has maintained since his 2016 campaign, NPR described him as \"no longer an underdog\" when he announced his 2020 campaign.[245] Nevertheless, his campaign has employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a Super PAC and relying predominantly on individual, small-dollar contributions. As of August 2019, The New York Times estimated that his campaign had brought in $46 per donor, compared to $80 per donor for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who have pursued fundraising methods focused on wealthier donors.[246]\nAccording to Federal Election Commission filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money of the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races.[247][248][249] In the second quarter of 2018, his campaign raised $18 million and transferred an additional $6 million from existing accounts, giving him the most cash on hand ($27 million) in the Democratic primary field. But he was outraised in the second quarter by Pete Buttigieg ($24 million), Joe Biden ($22 million), and Elizabeth Warren ($19 million).[250]\nIn September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million individual donors.[251] On October 1, 2019, the campaign announced it had raised $25.3 million in the year's third quarter, with an average donation of $18. It was the largest quarterly sum raised by any Democratic candidate. He also transferred another $2.6 million from other accounts to his presidential campaign.[252][253] The campaign raised $34.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.[254]\nThe Sanders campaign has used the internet and social media as key tools in its organizing efforts. Using the large email list it built during the 2016 campaign, the 2020 campaign recruited more than one million volunteers within weeks of its launch. It enlisted several former NowThis News employees to produce professional videos for wide social media distribution, has live-streamed various forums to its millions of social media followers, and has launched a podcast and smartphone app for grassroots organizing.[255]\nSanders steadily polled between 15-20% on most national surveys between May and September 2019, according to the RealClearPolitics average. This placed him in a decisive second-place behind Joe Biden until Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris caught up in July. As of September, Harris's support had dipped back into the single digits, while Warren and Sanders remained in a virtual tie for second place. Some surveys showed Warren ahead of him, while others showed the reverse.[256]\nNational surveys of a potential general election matchup with Donald Trump showed Sanders leading by an average of 6.5% as of September 2019, compared to a 11.7% lead for Biden and a 5% lead for Warren.[257] The average of polls in New Hampshire in August and September 2019 showed a virtual tie between candidates Sanders, Warren, and Biden.[258]\nAccording to a RealClearPolitics analysis, Sanders received the third-most most mentions on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC between January and August 2019, trailing only Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden, however, received twice as many mentions as Sanders and Harris. Mentions of Sanders on ABC World News Tonight found him in second place, though also trailing Biden by a large margin. Online mentions \"reflect a slightly more balanced picture,\" with both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren running \"neck-and-neck\" with Biden.[259]\nDuring the first three Democratic primary debates, Sanders appeared near the center stage, as one of the highest polling candidates. During the July and September debates, he and Elizabeth Warren were described by commentators as having a \"non-aggression pact\", staking out similar progressive positions in contrast to the more centrist candidates.[260][261]\nOn April 6, 2019, Sanders participated in a Fox News town hall that attracted more than 2.55 million viewers.[262][263] His decision to appear on Fox was controversial given the Democratic National Committee's decision not to allow Fox to host any of its debates, and he was criticized by surrogates of Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke and Joe Biden for appearing on the network.[264][265] His appearance on Fox News saw an increase of Fox News viewers by 24% overall and 40% in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, surpassing the ratings of all prior 2020 Democratic presidential candidate town halls. As of September 2019, the town hall has also received more than 1.5 million views on YouTube.[266]\nOn August 6, Sanders appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Some praised Rogan for \"hosting a pragmatic discussion\" while others \"seemed rather stunned by Sanders' decision to appear on the show at all.\" Following the podcast Rogan became a top-trending Twitter topic.[267] Rogan has been criticized by some progressives for interviewing people associated with the alt right, such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones. After interviewing him, Rogan said, \"I am not right-wing\u00a0... I've interviewed right-wing people. I am 100% left-wing\u00a0... Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I would 100% vote for him. Tulsi Gabbard is my favorite.\"[268] As of October 2019, the podcast had received more than 10 million views on YouTube.[269]\nSanders took part in the October 15 Democratic debate, his first appearance since his heart attack. Nationally recognized debate coach Todd Graham gave Sanders's performance an A, his highest rating of all the candidates, writing, \"when Joe Biden said, 'I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done' Sanders was ready to put things in perspective by replying, 'You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement) and PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations), with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.'\" Graham gave both Biden and Elizabeth Warren a C.[270]\nOn October 1, 2019, Sanders was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas. His campaign announced the next day that a blockage was found in one coronary artery and two stents were inserted.[271] Scheduled campaign events and appearances were canceled until further notice.[272] Two days later his campaign released a statement saying that he had been diagnosed with a heart attack. He was released from the hospital the same day.[271] The statement included the following from Sanders' doctors:[273]\nAfter presenting to an outside facility with chest pain, Sen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. He was immediately transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. The senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion. All other arteries were normal. His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.A few days after returning home, Sanders addressed media outside his home and said he had experienced fatigue and chest discomfort for a month or two before the incident; he expressed regret for not seeking medical assessment sooner: \"I was dumb\".[274]\nSanders made his first national appearance following his heart attack on October 15 at the Democratic debate, at which he said, \"I'm healthy, I'm feeling great.\" When asked how he would reassure voters about his health and ability to take on the duties of the presidency, he said, \"We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.\" It was noted that he was \"lively and sharp at the debate.\"[275]\nIn December 2019, three months after experiencing a heart attack, Sanders released letters from three physicians - Attending Physician of Congress Brian P. Monahan and two cardiologists - who declared Sanders as healthy and recovered from his heart condition.[276]\nProgressive Era\nRepression and persecution\nAnti-war and civil rights movements\nContemporary\nSanders is a self-described \"democratic socialist\",[277] and progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy and has been a proponent of workplace democracy.[278] He advocates for universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, as well as tuition-free tertiary education.\"[279] He supports lowering the cost of drugs by reforming patent laws to allow cheaper generic versions to be sold in the U.S.[280] He supported the Affordable Care Act, though he said it did not go far enough.[281]\nIn November 2015, he gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including its place in the policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.[282][283] In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: \"I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad.\"[282] Based on his positions and votes throughout his political career, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as \"a New Dealer\".[c][284] Other observers, such as Lane Kenworthy and Bhaskar Sunkara, suggest that his views are more closely related to those of social democrats.[285][286]\nSanders views global warming as a serious problem,[287] and advocates bold action to reverse its effects. He calls for substantial investment in infrastructure, with \"energy efficiency and sustainability\" and job creation as prominent goals.[288][289] He considers climate change the greatest threat to national security.[290][287] He said that family planning can help fight climate change.[291] He opposed the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the grounds that, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, it \"will have a significant impact on our climate.\"[292] In 2019, he announced his support for Green New Deal legislation,[293] and joined Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Earl Blumenauer in proposing legislation that would declare climate change a national and international emergency.[294]\nSanders focuses on economic issues such as income and wealth inequality,[295][296] poverty,[297] raising the minimum wage,[149] universal healthcare,[279] cancelling all student debt,[298] making public colleges and universities tuition-free by taxing financial transactions,[299] and expanding Social Security benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll tax on all incomes above $250,000.[300][301] He has become a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers parental leave, sick leave, and vacation time, noting that such laws have been adopted by nearly all other developed countries.[302] He also supports legislation that would make it easier for workers to join or form a trade union.[303][304] He was against the bank bailout,[305] and has called for comprehensive financial reforms,[306] such as breaking up \"too big to fail\" financial institutions, restoring Glass\u2013Steagall legislation, reforming the Federal Reserve Bank, and allowing the Post Office to offer basic financial services in economically marginalized communities.[307][308][309][310]\nBelieving greater emphasis is needed on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements, Sanders voted against and has long spoken against NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China. He has called them a \"disaster for the American worker\", saying that they have resulted in American corporations moving abroad. He also strongly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he says was \"written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street.\"[311][312] On May 1, 2019, he tweeted: \"Since the China trade deal I voted against, America has lost over three million manufacturing jobs. It's wrong to pretend that China isn't one of our major economic competitors.\"[313]\nOn foreign policy, Sanders broadly supports reducing military spending, pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation. He opposed funding Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, in the CIA's covert war against Nicaragua's leftist government.[314] He strongly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has criticized a number of policies instituted during the War on Terror, particularly that of mass surveillance and the USA Patriot Act.[315][316][317] He criticized Israel's bellicose actions during the 2014 Gaza war[318] and U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.[319] On November 15, 2015, in response to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s attacks in Paris, He cautioned against \"Islamophobia\" and said, \"We gotta be tough, not stupid\" in the war against ISIL, adding that the U.S. should continue to welcome Syrian refugees.[320] He criticized the January 2020 drone assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, calling it a dangerous escalation of tensions that could lead to an expensive war.[321]\nAddressing Westminster College in a September 2017 speech, Sanders laid out a \"progressive foreign policy\" that pushes for greater international collaboration, an adherence to U.S.-led international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal framework, and the promotion of human rights and democratic ideals. He emphasized the evils associated with \"outrageous\" global economic inequality and climate change, and urged reining in the use of U.S. military power, saying it \"must always be a last resort\". He also heavily criticized U.S. support for \"murderous regimes\" during the Cold War, such as those in Iran, Chile and El Salvador, and said that those actions continue to make the U.S. less safe.[322][323] He also spoke critically of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and the way President Trump has handled the crisis.[324] He condemned the Turkish military offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria, saying that Turkey is \"not a U.S. ally\".[325]\nSanders supports banning assault weapons, universal federal background checks for gun purchases, and closing the gun show loophole.[326][327][328] In 1990, he was supported by the NRA in his bid to become a U.S. Representative in exchange for opposing both the competing campaign of Peter Smith, who had reversed his stance on firearm restrictions, and waiting periods for handgun purchases.[329] In 1993, while a U.S. Representative, he voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (which established background checks and wait periods), and in 2005 he voted for legislation that gave gun manufacturers legal immunity against claims of negligence, but as of 2016[update] he has since said that he would support repealing that law.[98] In 1996, he voted against additional funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for research on issues related to firearms; but then in 2016, he called for an increase in CDC funding for the study of gun violence.[98]\nOn social issues, Sanders has long taken liberal stances.[330] He advocated for LGBT rights as Burlington mayor in 1983 and voted against the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. In 2006, he indicated that the time was not right for legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont, describing the issue as properly handled at the state, not the national, level; but then in 2009, he supported the legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont, which was enacted that year.[331] He considers himself a feminist,[332] is pro-choice on abortion, and opposes the de-funding of Planned Parenthood.[333] He has denounced institutional racism and called for criminal justice reform to reduce the number of people in prison,[334] advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports abolishing private, for-profit prisons[335][336][337] and the death penalty.[338] He supports Black Lives Matter.[339] He also supports legalizing marijuana at the federal level.[340] He has advocated for greater democratic participation by citizens, campaign finance reform, and a constitutional amendment or judicial decision that would overturn Citizens United v. FEC.[341][342][343]\nSanders criticized President Trump for appointing multiple billionaires to his cabinet.[344] He criticized Trump's rolling back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, noting the scientifically reported effect on climate change of human activity and citing Trump's calling those reports a hoax.[345] He called for caution on the Syrian Civil War, saying, \"it's easier to get into a war than out of one.\"[346] He has promised to defeat \"Trump and Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology\".[347]\nSanders condemned Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, because \"It would dramatically undermine the prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage the United States' ability to broker that peace.\"[348] He gave an online reply to Trump's January 2018 State of the Union address, where he called Trump \"compulsively dishonest\" and criticized him for initiating \"a looming immigration crisis\" by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He voiced concern about Trump's failure to mention the finding that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and \"will likely interfere in the 2018 midterms we will be holding\u00a0... Unless you have a very special relationship with Mr. Putin.\"[349]\nBorn into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956.[350] Although elected mayor of Burlington as an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that \"if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite\"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically.[351] The Washington Post reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.[351][41]\nOnce elected to the House of Representatives, Sanders joined the Democratic caucus, although some conservative southern Democrats initially barred him from the caucus as they believed that allowing a self-described socialist to join would harm their electoral prospects.[41] He soon came to work constructively with Democrats, voting with the party over 90% of the time during his tenure in the House and in the Senate.[41]\nStarting in November 2015, in connection with his presidential campaign, Sanders's announcements suggested that not only was he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections.[352][353][354] When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, \"Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination.\"[355] Since he remained a Senator elected as an independent, the United States Senate website continued to refer to him as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate.[356] He confirmed at the end of the campaign that he remained an independent in the Senate for the balance of his term since that was how he was elected.[357]\nSanders advocated that, following Trump's victory in the 2016 elections, the Democratic Party undergo a \"series of reforms\" and that it had to \"break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor.\"[358]  He drew parallels between his campaign and that of the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election.[359][360] He wrote in The New York Times that \"the British elections should be a lesson for the Democratic Party\" and urged the Democrats to stop holding on to an \"overly cautious, centrist ideology\", arguing that \"momentum shifted to Labour after it released a very progressive manifesto that generated much enthusiasm among young people and workers\".[361][362] He had earlier praised Jeremy Corbyn's stance on class issues.[363]\nIn October 2017, Sanders said he would run for reelection as an independent in 2018 though he was pressured to run as a Democrat.[364]  He joined Vermont's Liberty Union Party in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman,[53] but quit in 1977 to become an independent.[365] In 1980 he served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party.[366]\nIn 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent. He would later be reelected three times.[367] He first ran for the US House of Representatives in 1988 and for the US Senate in 2006, each time adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election.[368] He continued this strategy through his reelection in the 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont.[369] Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent. He caucused with the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the House[12] while refusing to join the Democratic caucus or party,[78] and caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate.[165]\nSanders's campaigns for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination have created some controversy about his affiliation. On the 2016 campaign trail, he affirmed that he was a Democrat running for the Democratic nomination.[355] But both his Senate website and press materials continued to label him as an \"independent\" during and after the campaign.[356][357] His party status became ambiguous once again in March 2019 when he signed a formal \"loyalty pledge\" to the Democratic Party stating that he is a member of the party and will serve as a Democrat if elected president. He signed the pledge the day after he signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to the Senate in 2024.[1]\nCommentators have noted the consistency of Sanders's views throughout his political career.[370][371] Many have examined his political platform and variety of democratic socialism and found it to be based on tax-funded social benefits rather than social ownership of the means of production.\nCommentators have variously described Sanders's political philosophy as \"welfarism\"[372] or \"social democracy\"[373] but not democratic socialism as defined as \"an attempt to create a property-free, socialist society\".[374]\nSome members of various US socialist parties and organizations have said that Sanders is a reformer of capitalism, not a socialist.[375][376][377]\nOthers distinguish among socialism, social democracy, and democratic socialism, and describe his philosophy as an extension of such existing liberal programs in the US as Social Security and Medicare[378][379][284] and more consistent with the social democracy found in much of Europe, especially the Nordic countries.[380][381]\nBefore his 2016 presidential run, Sanders was known as a legislator who advocated for progressive causes but \"rarely forged actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.\"[382] According to The New York Times, \"Big legislation largely eludes Mr. Sanders because his ideas are usually far to the left of the majority of the Senate\u00a0... Mr. Sanders has largely found ways to press his agenda through appending small provisions to the larger bills of others.\"[383] During his time in the Senate, he had lower \"legislative effectiveness\" than the average senator, as measured by the number of sponsored bills that passed and successful amendments made.[384]\nIn 1963, Sanders and Deborah Shiling Messing, whom he met in college, volunteered for several months on the Israeli kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim. They married in 1964 and bought a summer home in Vermont; they had no children and divorced in 1966.[27][385][386][387] His son (and only biological child), Levi Sanders, was born in 1969 to girlfriend Susan Campbell Mott.[25] In 1988, Sanders married Jane O'Meara Driscoll (n\u00e9e\u00a0Mary Jane O'Meara), who later became president of Burlington College, in Burlington, Vermont.[388] The day after their wedding, the couple visited the Soviet Union as part of an official delegation in his capacity as mayor.[389][390] He considers Jane's three children\u2014Dave Driscoll (born 1975), Carina Driscoll (born 1974), and Heather Titus (n\u00e9e\u00a0Driscoll; 1971)\u2014to be his own.[27][391] He also has seven grandchildren,[392] three (including one who was adopted) through his son Levi and four through his stepchildren.[393]\nIn December 1987, during his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Sanders recorded a folk album, We Shall Overcome, with 30 Vermont musicians. As he was not a skilled singer, he performed his vocals in a talking blues style.[394][395] He appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy-drama film Sweet Hearts Dance, playing a man who distributes candy to young trick-or-treaters.[396] In 1999, he acted in the film My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception, playing Rabbi Manny Shevitz. In this role he mourned the Brooklyn Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, reflecting Sanders's own upbringing in Brooklyn.[397] On February 6, 2016, he was a guest star alongside Larry David on Saturday Night Live, playing a Polish immigrant on a steamship that was sinking near the Statue of Liberty.[398]\nOn December 4, 2015, Sanders won Time's 2015 Person of the Year readers' poll with 10.2% of the vote[399][400] but did not receive the editorial board's award. On March 20, 2016, he was given an honorary Coast Salish name, dx\u02b7shudi\u010dup,[d] by Deborah Parker in Seattle to honor his focus on Native American issues during his presidential campaign.[401]\nSanders's elder brother, Larry, lives in England;[402] he was a Green Party county councillor, representing the East Oxford division on Oxfordshire County Council, until he retired from the Council in 2013.[403][404] Larry ran as a Green Party candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon in the 2015 British general election and came in fifth.[405][406] Sanders told CNN, \"I owe my brother an enormous amount. It was my brother who actually introduced me to a lot of my ideas.\"[406]\nOn May 30, 2017, Sanders received an Honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Brooklyn College.[407]\nAfter complaints made in 2016 by Donald Trump's Vermont campaign chairman, the FBI launched an investigation into his wife Jane's involvement in a bank loan for Burlington College when she was its president.[408][409][410][411] The Washington Post reported on June 25, 2017, that Sanders himself was not under FBI investigation.[412] Both he and his wife retained prominent counsel during the investigation.[410][411] In November 2018, the U.S. Attorney for Vermont informed Jane that the investigation had ended and that no charges would be filed.[413]\nIn 2016 and 2017, Sanders reported earnings of just over $1\u00a0million, mostly royalties and advances on the books he had published those years.[414][415] He and his wife own a row house in Capitol Hill, a house in Burlington's New North End neighborhood, and a lakefront summer home in North Hero.[416][417][418][419]\nAs Sanders described his upbringing as an American Jew in a 2016 speech: his father generally attended synagogue only on Yom Kippur; he attended public schools while his mother \"chafed\" at his yeshiva Sunday schooling at a Hebrew school; and their religious observances were mostly limited to Passover seders with their neighbors. Larry Sanders said of their parents, \"They were very pleased to be Jews, but didn't have a strong belief in God.\"[420] Bernie had a bar mitzvah[421] at the historic Kingsway Jewish Center in Midwood, Brooklyn, where he grew up.[420]\nIn 1963, in cooperation with the Labor Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair, Sanders and his first wife volunteered at Sha'ar HaAmakim, a kibbutz in northern Israel.[422][423][424][425] His motivation for the trip was as much socialistic as it was Zionistic.[420]\nAs mayor of Burlington, Sanders allowed a Chabad public menorah to be placed at city hall, an action the ACLU contested. He publicly inaugurated the Hanukkah menorah and performed the Jewish religious ritual of blessing Hanukkah candles.[420] His early and strong support played a significant role in the now widespread public menorah celebrations around the globe.[426][427][428][429] When asked about his Jewish heritage, Sanders has said that he is \"proud to be Jewish\".[425]\nSanders rarely speaks about religion.[421] He describes himself as \"not particularly religious\"[425] and \"not actively involved\" with organized religion.[421] A press package issued by his office states \"Religion: Jewish\".[430] He has said he believes in God, but not necessarily in a traditional manner: \"I think everyone believes in God in their own ways,\" he said. \"To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.\"[421][431] In October 2015, on the late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel asked him, \"You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you believe in God and do you think that's important to the people of the United States?\" Sanders replied:[432]\nI am who I am, and what I believe in and what my spirituality is about is that we're all in this together. That I think it is not a good thing to believe as human beings we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people\u00a0... and this is not Judaism, this is what Pope Francis is talking about, that we can't just worship billionaires and the making of more and more money. Life is more than that.\nIn 2016, he disclosed that he had \"very strong religious and spiritual feelings\", adding, \"My spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.\"[433]\nSanders does not regularly attend synagogue, and he works on Rosh Hashanah, a day Jews typically do not work. He has attended yahrzeit observances in memory of the deceased, for the father of a friend, and in 2015 attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.[420] According to his close friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, Sanders's Jewish identity is \"certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious\".[434] Deborah Dash Moore, a Judaic scholar at the University of Michigan, has said that Sanders has a particular type of \"ethnic Jewishness\" that is somewhat old-fashioned.[435] His wife is Roman Catholic, and he has frequently expressed admiration for Pope Francis, saying that \"the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound issues. It is important that we listen to what he has said.\" He has said he feels \"very close\" to Francis's economic teachings, describing him as \"incredibly smart and brave\".[11][436][437] In April 2016, he accepted an invitation from Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, an aide close to Francis, to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues. While at the Vatican, he met briefly with Francis.[438][439]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nStephen Kevin Bannon (born November 27, 1953) is an American media executive, political strategist, former investment banker, and the former executive chairman of Breitbart News. He served as White House Chief Strategist in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump during the first seven months of Trump's term.[2][3] He serves on the board of Cambridge Analytica,[4] the data-analytics firm involved in the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Bannon was an officer in the United States Navy for seven years in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After his military service, he worked at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker, and left as vice president. In 1993, he became acting director of the research project Biosphere 2. In the 1990s, he became an executive producer in Hollywood, and produced 18 films between 1991 and 2016. In 2007, he co-founded Breitbart News, a far-right[i] website which he described in 2016 as \"the platform for the alt-right\".[I] In August 2016, Bannon was named the chief executive officer of Trump's 2016 presidential bid.[22][23] Following Trump's victory, Bannon was appointed Chief Strategist in the Trump administration. He left this position on August 18, 2017 and rejoined Breitbart. In January 2018, Bannon was disavowed by Trump for critical comments reported in the book Fire and Fury,[24] and left Breitbart. After leaving the White House, Bannon opposed the Republican Party establishment and supported insurgent candidates in Republican primaries. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was questioned when Roy Moore, with Bannon's support, lost the 2017 United States Senate election in Alabama.[25][26] Bannon has declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement.\"[27] Accordingly, he has supported many national populist conservative political movements around the world. Stephen Kevin Bannon was born on November 27, 1953 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Doris (n\u00e9e Herr), a homemaker, and Martin J. Bannon Jr.,[28] who worked as an AT&T telephone lineman and as a middle manager.[29][30] His working class, Irish Catholic family was pro-Kennedy and pro-union Democrat.[31] Bannon graduated from Benedictine College Preparatory, a private, Catholic, military high school in Richmond, Virginia, in 1971,[32] and then attended Virginia Tech, where he served as the president of the student government association.[33] During the summers he worked at a local junk yard.[34] He graduated from Virginia Tech College of Architecture and Urban Studies in 1976, with a bachelor's degree in urban planning. While serving in the navy, he earned a master's degree in national security studies in 1983 from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service.[35] In 1985,[38] Bannon earned a Master of Business Administration degree with honors[39] from Harvard Business School.[40] Bannon was an officer in the United States Navy for seven years in the late 1970s and early 1980s; he served on the destroyer USS\u00a0Paul F. Foster as a surface warfare officer in the Pacific Fleet, and afterwards stateside as a special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations at the Pentagon.[41] Bannon's job at the Pentagon was, among other things, handling messages between senior officers and writing reports about the state of the Navy fleet worldwide.[42] While at the Pentagon, Bannon attended Georgetown University at night and obtained his master's degree in national security studies.[34] In 1980, Bannon was deployed to the Persian Gulf to assist with Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis. The mission's failure marked a turning point in his political world-view from largely apolitical to strongly Reaganite, which was further reinforced by the September 11 attacks.[43][44] Bannon has stated, \"I wasn't political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter fucked things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had fucked up as badly as Carter. The whole country was a disaster.\"[45] At the time of his separation from the Navy, Bannon held the rank of lieutenant (O-3).[1][a] After his military service, Bannon worked at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker in the Mergers and Acquisitions Department.[47] In 1987, he relocated from New York to Los Angeles, to assist Goldman in expanding their presence in the entertainment industry.[32] He stayed at this position with Goldman in Los Angeles for two years, and left with the title of vice president.[48][b] In 1990, Bannon and several colleagues from Goldman Sachs launched their own company Bannon & Co., a boutique investment bank specializing in media. In one of Bannon & Co.'s transactions, the firm represented Westinghouse Electric which wanted to sell Castle Rock Entertainment.[39] Bannon negotiated a sale of Castle Rock to Turner Broadcasting System, which was owned by Ted Turner at the time.[50] Instead of a full adviser's fee, Bannon & Co. accepted a financial stake in five television shows, including Seinfeld, which was in its third season. Bannon still receives cash residuals each time Seinfeld is aired.[50] Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale purchased Bannon & Co. in 1998.[39] In 1993, while still managing Bannon & Co., Bannon became acting director of the earth science research project Biosphere 2 in Oracle, Arizona. Under Bannon, the closed-system experiment project shifted emphasis from researching human space exploration and colonization toward the scientific study of earth's environment, pollution, and climate change. He left the project in 1995.[51][52] In the 1990s, Bannon ventured into entertainment and media, and became an executive producer in the Hollywood film and media industry. Bannon produced 18 films,[30] from Sean Penn's drama The Indian Runner (1991) to Julie Taymor's film Titus (1999). Bannon became a partner with entertainment industry executive Jeff Kwatinetz at film and television management company The Firm, Inc., 2002\u20132003.[39][53] In 2004, Bannon made a documentary about Ronald Reagan titled In the Face of Evil. Through the making and screening of this film, Bannon was introduced to Reagan's War author Peter Schweizer and publisher Andrew Breitbart, who would later describe him as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement.[39] Bannon was involved in the financing and production of a number of films, including Fire from the Heartland: The Awakening of the Conservative Woman (2010), The Undefeated (2011), and Occupy Unmasked (2012). Bannon persuaded Goldman Sachs to invest, in 2006, in a company known as Internet Gaming Entertainment.[54] Following a lawsuit, the company rebranded as Affinity Media, and Bannon took over as CEO. From 2007 through 2011, Bannon was the chair and CEO of Affinity Media.[55][56] In 2007, Bannon wrote an eight-page treatment for a new documentary called Destroying the Great Satan: The Rise of Islamic Facism (sic) in America. The outline states that \"although driven by the 'best intentions,' institutions such as the media, the Jewish community and government agencies were appeasing jihadists aiming to create an Islamic republic.\"[57] In 2011, Bannon spoke at the Liberty Restoration Foundation in Orlando, Florida, about the Economic Crisis of 2008, the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and their impact in the origins of the Tea Party movement, while also discussing his films Generation Zero (2010) and The Undefeated.[58] Bannon was executive chair and co-founder of the Government Accountability Institute, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (where he helped orchestrate the publication of Breitbart News senior editor-at-large[59] Peter Schweizer's book Clinton Cash),[39][60] from its founding in 2012 until his departure in August 2016.[61] For the years 2012 through 2015, he received between $81,000 and $100,000 each year; the organization reported that he worked an average of 30 hours per week for the organization.[61] He has also worked as vice president of the board of Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm which allegedly used illegal tactics to target American voters in the 2016 election and is owned largely by the Mercer family,[4] the family that also co-owns Breitbart News.[62] In 2015, Bannon was ranked No. 19 on Mediaite's list of the \"25 Most Influential in Political News Media 2015\".[63] Bannon also hosted a radio show (Breitbart News Daily) on the SiriusXM Patriot satellite radio channel.[64] Bannon was a founding member of the board of Breitbart News,[65] a right-wing news, opinion and commentary website. Philip Elliott and Zeke J. Miller of Time have said that the site has \"pushed racist, sexist, xenophobic and antisemitic material into the vein of the alternative right\".[14] Bannon said that Breitbart's ideological mix included libertarians, Zionists, the conservative gay community, same-sex marriage opponents, economic nationalists, populists, as well as alt-right, the alt-right comprising a very small proportion overall. Conceding the alt-right holds views with \"racial and anti-Semitic overtones,\" Bannon said he has zero tolerance for such views.[66][67] In March 2012, after founder Andrew Breitbart's death, Bannon became executive chair of Breitbart News LLC, the parent company of Breitbart News.[68][69][70] Under his leadership, Breitbart took a more alt-right and nationalistic approach toward its agenda.[71] In 2016, Bannon declared the website \"the platform for the alt-right\".[15] Speaking about his role at Breitbart, Bannon said: \"We think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly 'anti-' the permanent political class.\"[72] On August 18, 2017, Breitbart announced that Bannon would return as executive chairman following his period of employment at the White House.[73] On January 9, 2018, he stepped down as executive chairman.[74] Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor and colleague of Bannon, called Bannon a \"bully\" who \"sold out [Breitbart founder] Andrew's mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.\"[75] On August 17, 2016, with 88 days until the 2016 presidential election, Bannon was appointed chief executive of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.[76] Bannon left Breitbart, as well as the Government Accountability Institute[61] and Cambridge Analytica,[77] to take the job. Shortly after he assumed the chief executive role, the chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, was dismissed.[68][69][78][79][80] On November 13, following Donald Trump's election to the presidency, Bannon was appointed chief strategist and senior counselor to the President-elect.[81] His appointment drew opposition from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republican strategists because of statements in Breitbart News that were alleged to be racist or antisemitic.[22][23][82][83][84] A number of prominent conservative Jews, however, defended Bannon against the allegations of anti-Semitism, including Ben Shapiro,[84][85][86] David Horowitz,[87] Pamela Geller,[88] Bernard Marcus of the Republican Jewish Coalition,[89] Morton Klein[90] and the Zionist Organization of America,[89] and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.[91] Alan Dershowitz at first defended Bannon, saying there was no evidence he was antisemitic,[92][93] but then in a later piece stated that Bannon had made bigoted statements against Muslims, women, and others.[94] The ADL stated \"We are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements from Bannon.\"[95] Shapiro, who previously worked as an editor-at-large at Breitbart, said he had no evidence of Bannon being racist or an antisemite, but that Bannon was \"happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into European far-right nationalist populism\".[96] Bannon had referred to French National Front (now National Rally) politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen as \"the new rising star\".[97] On November 15, 2016, U.S. Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island released a letter to Trump signed by 169 Democratic House Representatives urging the President-Elect to rescind his appointment of Bannon. The letter stated that appointing Bannon \"sends a disturbing message about what kind of president Donald Trump wants to be\",[98][99][100] because his \"ties to the White Nationalist movement have been well documented\"; it went on to present several examples of Breitbart News' alleged xenophobia.[101] Bannon denied being a white nationalist and claimed, rather, that he was an \"economic nationalist.\"[102] On November 18, during his first interview not conducted by Breitbart Media since the 2016 presidential election, Bannon remarked on some criticisms made about him, saying, \"Darkness is good: Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power. It only helps us when they get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing.\"[103][104] The quote was published widely in the media.[103][105][106][107] In an interview with The New York Times in late November, Trump responded to the controversy over Bannon's appointment, saying, \"I've known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right, or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him.\"[108] In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Bannon said that his role in was to \"recalibrate\" the campaign which had at that point lost its message. He \"stepped in and got the campaign refocused\", but he rebuffed the idea that he was the reason Trump won the presidency, saying \"Trump is unique in American political history, he's his own closer\". But that his role was to make sure that Hilary Clinton was held up as a \"guardian of a corrupt and incompetent establishment\" and this that was key to winning votes in states that Trump needed to win. [109] Reuters reported on October 31, 2018 that the Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting a \"wide-ranging\" investigation of Bannon's activities during the campaign, including knowledge he may have had about any contacts between Russia and two campaign advisors, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, as well as his role with Cambridge Analytica.[110] Upon his inauguration, Trump appointed Bannon to be his Chief Strategist, a newly created position. The title made him a senior advisor to the president, nearly equivalent in authority to the Chief of Staff.[111] As a staff member in the Executive Office of the President, the position did not require Senate confirmation.[112] Breitbart News editor Julia Hahn followed Bannon to the White House, where she was appointed as Bannon's aide, as well as Special Assistant to President Trump.[113] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in the aftermath of the 2016 election, Bannon analogized his influence to that of \"Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors\".[114][115][116] Several days after Donald Trump's inauguration, Bannon told The New York Times, \"The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. I want you to quote this: the media here is the opposition party. They don't understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\"[117] Bannon, along with Stephen Miller, was involved in the creation of Executive Order 13769, which resulted in restricted U.S. travel and immigration by individuals from seven countries, suspension of the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days, and indefinite suspension of the entry of Syrians to the United States.[118][119] According to The Economist, a British news magazine, Bannon and Miller \"see Mr [Vladimir] Putin as a fellow nationalist and crusader against cosmopolitanism.\"[120] In February 2017, Bannon appeared on the cover of Time, on which he was labeled \"the Great Manipulator\".[121] The headline used for the associated article was \"Is Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?\", alluding to Bannon's perceived influence in the White House.[122] In a March 14, 2019 hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross was questioned about his conversations regarding the adding of a citizenship question to the 2020 census surveys, which he had with Bannon, who in turn had referred him to immigration hardliners Kris Kobach and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Missouri Democratic Representative Lacy Clay accused Ross of being \"complicit\" regarding his efforts to weaken minority group voting rights, additionally accusing him of committing perjury with respect to those contacts. Clay called for Ross to tender his resignation, saying, \"You lied to Congress. You misled the American people and you are complicit in the Trump administration's intent to suppress the growing political power of the non-white population.\" Ross said the change was in response to a request by the Justice Department for statistics to protect voting rights.[123] On April 23, 2019, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments regarding appeals of rejections by three circuit courts of the proposed inclusion of the survey question.[124] It was reported that he intentionally published stories to undermine H.R. McMaster. Bannon allegedly did this by leaking information to the alternative media, including alt-right writer Mike Cernovich.[125][126] It was also reported that the Trump administration retroactively granted Bannon a blanket exemption from federal ethics rules that allowed him to communicate with editors at Breitbart News,[127] which according to former Breitbart consultant Kurt Bardella would be proof of the administration's intent to allow him to continue being \"the de facto editorial director of Breitbart\".[128] At the end of January 2017, in a departure from the previous format of the National Security Council (NSC), the holder of Bannon's position, along with that of the Chief of Staff, were designated by presidential memorandum as regular attendees to the NSC's Principals Committee, a Cabinet-level senior inter-agency forum for considering national security issues.[129][130] The enacted arrangement was criticized by several members of previous administrations and was called \"stone cold crazy\" by Susan E. Rice, Barack Obama's last national security adviser.[131] In response, White House spokesman Sean Spicer pointed to Bannon's seven years experience as a Navy officer in justifying his presence on the Committee.[132] Bannon was removed from his NSC role in early April 2017 in a reorganization by U.S. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, whom Bannon had helped select.[133] Some White House officials said Bannon's main purpose in serving on the committee was as a check against former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned in February 2017 for misleading the vice president about a conversation with the Russian ambassador to the United States.[134][135] Hence, with Flynn gone, Bannon was no longer needed.[133] Bannon reportedly opposed his removal from the council and threatened to quit if president Trump went forward with it, although Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer urged him to stay.[4] The White House said Bannon had not attempted to leave, and Bannon said any indication that he threatened resignation was \"total nonsense\".[136] Bannon only attended one NSC meeting.[137] Bannon's employment in the White House ended on August 18, 2017, less than a week after the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally which degenerated into violence and acrimony. Whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'\".[138] The decision to blame \"many sides\" was reported to have come from Bannon.[139] The NAACP released a statement saying that while they \"acknowledge and appreciate President Trump's disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today\", they called on Trump \"to take the tangible step to remove Steve Bannon\u00a0\u2013 a well-known white supremacist leader\u00a0\u2013 from his team of advisers\". The statement further described Bannon as a \"symbol of white nationalism\" who \"energized that sentiment\" through his current position within the White House.[140][141] Some sources stated that White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly asked Bannon on August 18, 2017, to submit his immediate resignation in lieu of being fired.[142] Bannon, however, stated he was not fired but rather submitted his two-week resignation notice on August 4, 2017.[143] He reminded The Weekly Standard that he had joined then-presidential candidate Trump's campaign on August 14, 2016, and said he'd \"always planned on spending one year,\" but that he stayed a few more days due to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.[144] In an official statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \"John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.\"[145][146][147] The same day, Breitbart News announced that Bannon would return to the site as executive chairman.[73] Several weeks after his departure it was reported that Trump still called Bannon using his personal cell phone, and was only calling when chief of staff Kelly was not around.[148] The Washington Post reported in October 2017 that Trump and Bannon remained in regular contact.[149] After leaving the White House, Bannon declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement.\"[27] Accordingly, he has supported many national populist conservative political movements around the world. These include France's National Front (now the National Rally),[150] Hungary's Fidesz,[151] the Italian League,[152] the Five Star Movement,[153] the Brothers of Italy,[154] Alternative for Germany,[155] the Polish Law and Justice,[156] the Sweden Democrats,[157] the Dutch Party for Freedom,[158] the Freedom Party of Austria,[159] the Swiss People's Party,[160] the UK Independence Party,[161] the Flemish Vlaams Belang,[162] the Belgian People's Party,[162] Spain's Vox,[163] the Finns Party,[162] the UK Conservative Party,[164][165][166][167][168] the pan-European identitarian movement,[169] Republika Srpska's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats,[170] the Brazilian 2018 Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign,[171] and the Israeli Likud.[172] Bannon believes that these movements\u00a0\u2013 along with Japan's Shinzo Abe, India's Narendra Modi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Saudi Arabia's Mohammad bin Salman, China's Xi Jinping, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and America's Donald Trump, as well as similar leaders in Egypt, the Philippines, Poland, and South Korea\u00a0\u2013 are part of a global shift towards nationalism.[173][174][175] In October 2019, Bannon began co-hosting War Room: Impeachment a daily radio show and podcast to nudge the White House and its allies into taking a more focused and aggressive posture to counteract the Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. [176] In November 2019, Bannon was compelled to testify in the trial of Roger Stone. Bannon testified that Stone was the wikileaks access point for the Trump campaign, to establish that Stone lied to Congress. Stone was subsequently convicted on all charges.[177][178] Bannon has made efforts to unseat incumbent Republican members of Congress he deemed to be insufficiently supportive of Trump's agenda.[179][180][181] In October Bannon said he planned to sponsor primary challenges against six of the seven incumbent Republican senators in the 2018 elections. He said he had two requirements for a candidate to earn his support: they must pledge to vote against Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader and to end the Senate filibuster.[182] Bannon received credit for helping Roy Moore defeat incumbent Senator Luther Strange in the September Republican primary for the 2017 special Alabama Senate election, despite Trump's having endorsed Strange.[183] After nine women alleged sexual misconduct, Bannon doubled down on his support for the candidate, raising doubt about the veracity of the accusations.[184] When Ivanka Trump condemned Moore's campaign in Alabama, saying \"there's a special place in hell for people who prey on children\", Bannon responded, \"What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?\", in reference to a woman who accused Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein of raping her at that age. (In August 2018, the New York Post alleged that Bannon was then trying to restore Epstein's favor for financial gain.[185]) In what had been considered a safe Republican seat, Moore lost in the special senate election on December 12, 2017. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was questioned by Republican commentators.[25] In January 2018, upon the publication of Michael Wolff's widely discredited[186][187][188][189][190] book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which attributed many controversial and inflammatory statements to Bannon, Bannon and Trump became estranged and were widely seen as enemies.[191][192] The book quoted Bannon as saying that Ivanka Trump was \"as dumb as a brick\";[24] that the meeting among Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and agents of Russia was \"treasonous\";[193] and that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller would cause Donald Trump Jr. to \"crack like an egg on live television\".[194] Bannon also warned that investigators would likely uncover money laundering involving Jared Kushner and his family business loans from Deutsche Bank.[195] Trump promptly disavowed Bannon, saying that Bannon \"lost his mind\" when he left the White House, and attacking him in multiple angry statements.[196][197] In a tweet on the evening of January 4, 2018, Trump referred to Bannon as \"Sloppy Steve\";[198] two days later, he alleged in another tweet that Bannon had \"cried when he got fired and begged for his job.\"[199] On January 7, 2018, Bannon expressed regret over his delayed response, declared his \"unwavering\" support for Trump and his agenda, and praised Donald Trump Jr.[200] Bannon said his remarks about the campaign meeting were aimed at Manafort instead of Trump Jr., a claim which Wolff contested.[201] Because of the break with Trump, Bannon's position as head of Breitbart News was called into question by Breitbart's owners,[26][202] and on January 9 it was announced that he had stepped down as executive chairman.[74] In his 2019 book Siege, Wolff wrote, \u201cTrump was vulnerable because for 40 years he had run what increasingly seemed to resemble a semi-criminal enterprise,\u201d then quoted Bannon as saying, \u201cI think we can drop the 'semi' part.\u201d Wolff wrote that Bannon predicted investigations into Trump's finances would be his political downfall, quoting Bannon as saying \"This is where it isn't a witch hunt \u2013 even for the hard core, this is where he turns into just a crooked business guy, and one worth $50 million instead of $10 billion. Not the billionaire he said he was, just another scumbag.\"[203] In August 2018, Bannon met with Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, and served as informal advisor to the Bolsonaro campaign in the Brazilian presidential elections that year.[171] In February 2019, the younger Bolsonaro joined Bannon's organization The Movement as its representative in South America.[204][205] In March 2019, Bannon met with both Bolsonaros in Washington, D.C.[206] Bannon told journalist Michael Lewis in February 2018, \"We got elected on Drain the Swamp, Lock Her Up, Build a Wall. This was pure anger. Anger and fear is what gets people to the polls.\" He added, \"The Democrats don't matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\"[207] A self-described economic nationalist, Bannon advocates for reductions in immigration[208] and restrictions on free trade with China and Mexico.[209][210] Bannon is a skeptic of military intervention abroad and has opposed proposals for the expansion of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan,[211] Syria,[212] and Venezuela.[213] He has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel. He has been described as a white nationalist, but rejects the description.[214] Bannon is in favor of raising federal income taxes to 44% for those earning incomes over $5 million a year as a way to pay for middle class tax cuts.[215] He also supports significantly increasing spending on infrastructure, describing himself as \"the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan\".[216] Bannon is opposed to government bailouts, describing them as \"socialism for the very wealthy\".[217] He generally believes in reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, declaring at the Conservative Political Action Conference he favored the \"deconstruction of the administrative state\".[218] However, he does support increased regulation of Internet companies like Facebook and Google, which he regards as akin to utilities in the modern age.[219] He opposed the merger between Time-Warner and AT&T on antitrust grounds.[220] He was a strong opponent of the Paris climate agreement within the administration, successfully persuading the President to withdraw from it.[221] He is generally skeptical of military intervention abroad, opposing proposals for the expansion of U.S. involvement in the War in Afghanistan,[211] the Syrian Civil War,[212] and the crisis in Venezuela.[213] In Afghanistan, he supported a proposal by Erik Prince for the deployment of private military contractors instead of the U.S. military.[222] He believes \"there is no military solution\" to the 2017 North Korea crisis.[209] Bannon has described U.S. allies in Europe, the Persian Gulf, the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca, as well as South Korea and Japan, as having become \"protectorates of the United States\" that do not \"make an effort to defend [themselves]\", and believes NATO members should pay a minimum of 2% of GDP on defense.[223] He also supports repairing United States-Russia relations and opposes upgrading the U.S. nuclear arsenal.[224] Bannon strongly favors U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal,[225] and was supportive of the approach taken by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis[226] and the 2017 Saudi Arabian purge.[citation needed] He believes Qatar is \"no less dangerous\" than North Korea.[227] Bannon believes Iran, Turkey and China are forming a \"new axis\" to challenge the West,[228] and has described Turkey as \"the greatest danger facing the United States\" and \"far more dangerous than Iran\".[227] Bannon reportedly speaks often with Trump donor Sheldon Adelson, and has been alarmed at a push for a renewed Middle East peace process.[229] He has described Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as a \"terrorist\".[230] He has advocated giving the land in the West Bank to Jordan and in Gaza to Egypt.[231] Although Bannon initially favored the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL) in the United Kingdom,[232] he later backed the UK Independence Party (UKIP).[161] Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP, once presented Bannon with a portrait of Bannon dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte.[233] Bannon has encouraged Farage to return as leader of UKIP.[234] After former EDL leader Tommy Robinson was sentenced to 13 months in prison for contempt of court, Bannon has called for his release, describing Robinson as the \"backbone\" of Britain.[235] Bannon has also called for a revolt in the United Kingdom should the country adopt a soft Brexit, stating, \"If I was in middle England and said this wasn't what I voted for I would rise up and make sure the guys in parliament knew it.\" When asked whether this should be interpreted as a \"call to arms\", he replied: \"Absolutely\".[235] Bannon has met with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prospective candidate for the leadership of the country's Conservative Party,[236] describing him as \"one of the best thinkers in the conservative movement on a global basis.\"[237] Bannon also urged current British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another potential leadership contender, who Bannon said in July 2018 that he had known \"over the last year\" and was \"very impressed\" with, to challenge then-Prime Minister Theresa May.[238][239] According to a Buzzfeed News report, Bannon was in private contact with Johnson during his visit to Britain that month, and the two men were previously in text communication during their respective tenures as White House Chief Strategist and British Foreign Secretary.[240] Bannon gave a talk at the Institute for Human Dignity, a conservative catholic group based in Rome, at a Vatican meeting in 2014 via Skype from Los Angeles.[241] He expressed a belief that traditionalists see Russia as an ally. Bannon said they \"believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism\u2014and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country. They want to see nationalism for their country\" rather than a \"pan-European Union\".[242] Bannon, wrote Isobel Thompson in Vanity Fair in July 2018, \"has been busy cultivating a new generation of nativist, pro-Russian leaders in Europe to invert the continent's current liberal-democratic orientation\".[242] However, in the 2014 speech, Bannon insisted: \"I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy.\"[241] In July 2018, Bannon announced plans to launch a new political operation beginning with an attempt to unite populist parties across Europe before the 2019 European Parliament election. With the project to be based in Brussels, he indicated he would spend 50% of his time in Europe from the following November working at locations throughout the continent.[243] Bannon formed a foundation around 2018 for nationalist parties called The Movement.[244] Bannon is supportive of European right-wing populist national conservative movements such as the Hungarian Fidesz, the French National Front (now National Rally), the Spanish Vox, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany, the Italian Northern League, the Brothers of Italy, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Sweden Democrats, the Finns Party, the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Belgian People's Party, the Polish National Movement, and the Swiss People's Party.[154][157][161][162][245][246][247][248] Bannon has also praised the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party government of Narendra Modi in India,[249] and Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party government in Japan.[250] Bannon called Chinese people \"the salt of the earth \u2014 hardworking, decent, family-oriented\", but he believes that Xi Jinping's communist regime in Beijing presents \"the greatest existential danger\" ever to the United States \"because we have never faced an opponent with the scale and ambitions of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party\".[251] Bannon criticized China's construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea.[251] In his talk delivered to a small conference in the Vatican during 2014, Bannon said: \"If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places ... it bequeathed to us the great institution that is the church of the West\".[252] He is reputed to believe Putin's Russia and Trump's America are Christian allies against the Islamic State and \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d.[253][254][255] Bannon's political and economic views have been described by others as nationalist,[256] right-wing populist,[257] and paleoconservative.[258] He self-identifies as a conservative.[78][259][260] He rejects allegations that he is a white nationalist,[214] calling white nationalists \"losers\", a \"fringe element\", and a \"collection of clowns\",[209] and describing white supremacist Richard Spencer as a \"self promoting freak\" and a \"goober\".[261] At a party congress in March 2018, Bannon gave members of the French right-wing populist National Front (NF) what has been described as a \"populist pep talk\".[150] Bannon advised the party members to \"Let them call you racist, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it like a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker. ... History is on our side and will bring us victory.\" Bannon's remarks brought the members to their feet.[262][263][264][265] Critics expressed concern that Bannon was \"normalizing racism.\"[266] Bannon generally considers charges of racism made against the right to be the result of a biased media.[267] Donald Trump has previously referred to Bannon as \"more of a libertarian than anything else\",[268] although at least one libertarian commentator has disputed this claim.[269] Bannon has been described as a \"policy intellectual\".[270] Bannon often describes himself as an economic nationalist, criticizing crony capitalism, Austrian economics, and the Objectivist capitalism of Ayn Rand, which he believes seeks to \"make people commodities, and to objectify people.\"[214][271][272][273] However, he has also stated that he generally considers himself a free market capitalist, believing it to be \"the underpinnings of our society\", while noting that he believes America is \"more than an economy\".[223] He has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel.[274][275][276] Bannon's strategic thinking has been influenced by Neil Howe's and William Strauss's Fourth Turning theory, which proposes that \"populism, nationalism and state-run authoritarianism would soon be on the rise, not just in America but around the world. [... Once one strips] away the extraneous accidents and technology, you are left with only a limited number of social moods, which tend to recur in a fixed order. [...] Forests need periodic fires; rivers need periodic floods. Societies, too.\"[277] The book is said to have been a major influence on Bannon's film Generation Zero.[278] A former practitioner of Zen meditation, and a nominal Roman Catholic,[279] Bannon's political thinking has been influenced by the politics of American populism exemplified by Andrew Jackson, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, James K. Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, and Trump; by Pope Pius XI's socio-political philosophy of subsidiarity, as expressed in the 1931 papal encyclical, Quadragesimo anno, defending that political matters ought to be handled by the lowest, least centralized competent authority; and by Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non's Traditionalism, extolling the social efficacy of spiritual ideas transmitted by \"primordial\" faith traditions such as Vedanta, Buddhism, Sufism, and medieval Christianity, which it argued were under attack by Western secularism. Bannon was particularly influenced by the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita and the ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War.[280][281] Bannon has also cited Alexander Dugin's Russian nationalist variant of Traditionalism called Eurasianism.[282][283] Lebanese-American author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, neoreactionary blogger Curtis Yarvin and conservative intellectual Michael Anton have been pointed out as three of the main influences in Steve Bannon's political thinking.[278][284] Bannon is an admirer of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan.[285] Bannon's favorite columnist is academic Walter Russell Mead.[286] Political theorist and philosopher Edmund Burke has also been described as a major influence on Bannon's ideological outlook.[287] In a 2014 speech to a Vatican conference, Bannon made a passing reference to Julius Evola, a twentieth-century, Nazi-linked Italian writer who influenced Benito Mussolini's Italian Fascism and promoted the Traditionalist School, described by a New York Times writer as \"a worldview popular in far-right and alternative religious circles that believes progress and equality are poisonous illusions.\" Bannon's interest in the ideas of the Traditionalist School was driven by Evola's book Revolt Against the Modern World, and Gu\u00e9non's books Man and his Becoming according to the Vedanta and The Crisis of the Modern World.[288] In March 2016, Bannon stated he appreciates \"any piece that mentions Evola.\"[289] In referring to the associated views of Vladimir Putin, who is influenced by Evola follower Dugin, Bannon stated \"We, the Judeo-Christian West, really have to look at what he's talking about as far as Traditionalism goes\u00a0\u2014 particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism.\"[290] He has likewise quoted French anti-Enlightenment writer Charles Maurras approvingly to a French diplomat.[291][292] Bannon has also repeatedly referenced the controversial French novel The Camp of the Saints (1973) by Jean Raspail, which depicts Third World immigration destroying Western civilization.[293] He has embraced what BBC News describes as Savitri Devi's \"account of history as a cyclical battle between good and evil\".[294] Bannon told an interviewer in 2018 that he is \"fascinated by Mussolini\", noting: \"He was clearly loved by women. He was a guy's guy. He has all that virility. He also had amazing fashion sense, right, that whole thing with the uniforms.\"[295] German film director Leni Riefenstahl, who produced propaganda films for the regime in Nazi Germany, is said to have influenced Bannon's film-making techniques, with Bannon once describing himself to writing colleague Julia Jones as the \"Riefenstahl of George Bush\", modifying the ending as \"the GOP\" when Jones was horrified.[296] The opening of Bannon's documentary film The Hope & The Change (2012) consciously imitated Riefenstahl's film The Triumph of the Will (1935), which depicted the Nuremberg Rally held in 1934.[297] According to The Guardian (London) in January 2018, Bannon's ideology is substantially similar to that of Stephen Miller, Tucker Carlson, Benny Johnson, Raheem Kassam and Matthew Boyle, the latter two having been prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Bannon at Breitbart.[298] Bannon has been married and divorced three times. He has three adult daughters. His first marriage was to Cathleen Suzanne Houff.[299] Bannon and Houff had a daughter, Maureen, in 1988 and subsequently divorced.[82][300] Bannon's second marriage was to Mary Louise Piccard, a former investment banker, in April 1995. Their twin daughters were born three days after the wedding. Piccard filed for dissolution of their marriage in 1997.[301][302] Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery, and dissuading a witness in early January 1996 after Piccard accused Bannon of domestic abuse. The Santa Monica Police Department crime report states that after Piccard called 911, an officer arrived at their home and observed red marks on Piccard's wrist and neck.[303] The charges were later dropped when Piccard did not appear in court.[304] In an article in The New York Times Piccard stated her absence was due to threats made to her by Bannon and his lawyer: Mr. Bannon, she said, told her that \"if I went to court, he and his attorney would make sure that I would be the one who was guilty\" ... Mr. Bannon's lawyer, she said, \"threatened me,\" telling her that if Mr. Bannon went to jail, she \"would have no money and no way to support the children.\" ... Mr. Bannon's lawyer ... denied pressuring her not to testify.[305]Piccard and Bannon divorced in 1997. During the divorce proceedings, Piccard alleged that Bannon had made antisemitic remarks about her choice of schools, saying he did not want to send his children to The Archer School for Girls because there were too many Jews at the school, and Jews raise their children to be \"whiny brats\". Bannon's spokesperson denied the accusation, noting that he had chosen to send both his children to the Archer School.[304][306][307][308][309] Bannon's third marriage was to Diane Clohesy; they married in 2006 and divorced in 2009.[310][311] Bannon has been a producer, writer or director on the following films and documentaries:",

He served as White House Chief Strategist in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump during the first seven months of Trump's term.[2][3] He serves on the board of Cambridge Analytica,[4] the data-analytics firm involved in the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal.\nBannon was an officer in the United States Navy for seven years in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After his military service, he worked at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker, and left as vice president. In 1993, he became acting director of the research project Biosphere 2. In the 1990s, he became an executive producer in Hollywood, and produced 18 films between 1991 and 2016. In 2007, he co-founded Breitbart News, a far-right[i] website which he described in 2016 as \"the platform for the alt-right\".[I]\nIn August 2016, Bannon was named the chief executive officer of Trump's 2016 presidential bid.[22][23] Following Trump's victory, Bannon was appointed Chief Strategist in the Trump administration. He left this position on August 18, 2017 and rejoined Breitbart. In January 2018, Bannon was disavowed by Trump for critical comments reported in the book Fire and Fury,[24] and left Breitbart.\nAfter leaving the White House, Bannon opposed the Republican Party establishment and supported insurgent candidates in Republican primaries. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was questioned when Roy Moore, with Bannon's support, lost the 2017 United States Senate election in Alabama.[25][26] Bannon has declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement.\"[27] Accordingly, he has supported many national populist conservative political movements around the world.\nStephen Kevin Bannon was born on November 27, 1953 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Doris (n\u00e9e Herr), a homemaker, and Martin J. Bannon Jr.,[28] who worked as an AT&amp;T telephone lineman and as a middle manager.[29][30] His working class, Irish Catholic family was pro-Kennedy and pro-union Democrat.[31]\nBannon graduated from Benedictine College Preparatory, a private, Catholic, military high school in Richmond, Virginia, in 1971,[32] and then attended Virginia Tech, where he served as the president of the student government association.[33] During the summers he worked at a local junk yard.[34]\nHe graduated from Virginia Tech College of Architecture and Urban Studies in 1976, with a bachelor's degree in urban planning. While serving in the navy, he earned a master's degree in national security studies in 1983 from Georgetown University School of Foreign Service.[35] In 1985,[38] Bannon earned a Master of Business Administration degree with honors[39] from Harvard Business School.[40]\nBannon was an officer in the United States Navy for seven years in the late 1970s and early 1980s; he served on the destroyer USS\u00a0Paul F. Foster as a surface warfare officer in the Pacific Fleet, and afterwards stateside as a special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations at the Pentagon.[41] Bannon's job at the Pentagon was, among other things, handling messages between senior officers and writing reports about the state of the Navy fleet worldwide.[42] While at the Pentagon, Bannon attended Georgetown University at night and obtained his master's degree in national security studies.[34]\nIn 1980, Bannon was deployed to the Persian Gulf to assist with Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis. The mission's failure marked a turning point in his political world-view from largely apolitical to strongly Reaganite, which was further reinforced by the September 11 attacks.[43][44] Bannon has stated, \"I wasn't political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter fucked things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had fucked up as badly as Carter. The whole country was a disaster.\"[45]\nAt the time of his separation from the Navy, Bannon held the rank of lieutenant (O-3).[1][a]\nAfter his military service, Bannon worked at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker in the Mergers and Acquisitions Department.[47] In 1987, he relocated from New York to Los Angeles, to assist Goldman in expanding their presence in the entertainment industry.[32] He stayed at this position with Goldman in Los Angeles for two years, and left with the title of vice president.[48][b]\nIn 1990, Bannon and several colleagues from Goldman Sachs launched their own company Bannon &amp; Co., a boutique investment bank specializing in media. In one of Bannon &amp; Co.'s transactions, the firm represented Westinghouse Electric which wanted to sell Castle Rock Entertainment.[39] Bannon negotiated a sale of Castle Rock to Turner Broadcasting System, which was owned by Ted Turner at the time.[50] Instead of a full adviser's fee, Bannon &amp; Co. accepted a financial stake in five television shows, including Seinfeld, which was in its third season. Bannon still receives cash residuals each time Seinfeld is aired.[50] Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale purchased Bannon &amp; Co. in 1998.[39]\nIn 1993, while still managing Bannon &amp; Co., Bannon became acting director of the earth science research project Biosphere 2 in Oracle, Arizona. Under Bannon, the closed-system experiment project shifted emphasis from researching human space exploration and colonization toward the scientific study of earth's environment, pollution, and climate change. He left the project in 1995.[51][52]\nIn the 1990s, Bannon ventured into entertainment and media, and became an executive producer in the Hollywood film and media industry. Bannon produced 18 films,[30] from Sean Penn's drama The Indian Runner (1991) to Julie Taymor's film Titus (1999). Bannon became a partner with entertainment industry executive Jeff Kwatinetz at film and television management company The Firm, Inc., 2002\u20132003.[39][53]\nIn 2004, Bannon made a documentary about Ronald Reagan titled In the Face of Evil. Through the making and screening of this film, Bannon was introduced to Reagan's War author Peter Schweizer and publisher Andrew Breitbart, who would later describe him as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement.[39] Bannon was involved in the financing and production of a number of films, including Fire from the Heartland: The Awakening of the Conservative Woman (2010), The Undefeated (2011), and Occupy Unmasked (2012).\nBannon persuaded Goldman Sachs to invest, in 2006, in a company known as Internet Gaming Entertainment.[54] Following a lawsuit, the company rebranded as Affinity Media, and Bannon took over as CEO. From 2007 through 2011, Bannon was the chair and CEO of Affinity Media.[55][56]\nIn 2007, Bannon wrote an eight-page treatment for a new documentary called Destroying the Great Satan: The Rise of Islamic Facism (sic) in America. The outline states that \"although driven by the 'best intentions,' institutions such as the media, the Jewish community and government agencies were appeasing jihadists aiming to create an Islamic republic.\"[57] In 2011, Bannon spoke at the Liberty Restoration Foundation in Orlando, Florida, about the Economic Crisis of 2008, the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and their impact in the origins of the Tea Party movement, while also discussing his films Generation Zero (2010) and The Undefeated.[58]\nBannon was executive chair and co-founder of the Government Accountability Institute, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (where he helped orchestrate the publication of Breitbart News senior editor-at-large[59] Peter Schweizer's book Clinton Cash),[39][60] from its founding in 2012 until his departure in August 2016.[61] For the years 2012 through 2015, he received between $81,000 and $100,000 each year; the organization reported that he worked an average of 30 hours per week for the organization.[61] He has also worked as vice president of the board of Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm which allegedly used illegal tactics to target American voters in the 2016 election and is owned largely by the Mercer family,[4] the family that also co-owns Breitbart News.[62]\nIn 2015, Bannon was ranked No. 19 on Mediaite's list of the \"25 Most Influential in Political News Media 2015\".[63]\nBannon also hosted a radio show (Breitbart News Daily) on the SiriusXM Patriot satellite radio channel.[64]\nBannon was a founding member of the board of Breitbart News,[65] a right-wing news, opinion and commentary website. Philip Elliott and Zeke J. Miller of Time have said that the site has \"pushed racist, sexist, xenophobic and antisemitic material into the vein of the alternative right\".[14] Bannon said that Breitbart's ideological mix included libertarians, Zionists, the conservative gay community, same-sex marriage opponents, economic nationalists, populists, as well as alt-right, the alt-right comprising a very small proportion overall. Conceding the alt-right holds views with \"racial and anti-Semitic overtones,\" Bannon said he has zero tolerance for such views.[66][67]\nIn March 2012, after founder Andrew Breitbart's death, Bannon became executive chair of Breitbart News LLC, the parent company of Breitbart News.[68][69][70] Under his leadership, Breitbart took a more alt-right and nationalistic approach toward its agenda.[71] In 2016, Bannon declared the website \"the platform for the alt-right\".[15] Speaking about his role at Breitbart, Bannon said: \"We think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly 'anti-' the permanent political class.\"[72]\nOn August 18, 2017, Breitbart announced that Bannon would return as executive chairman following his period of employment at the White House.[73] On January 9, 2018, he stepped down as executive chairman.[74]\nBen Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor and colleague of Bannon, called Bannon a \"bully\" who \"sold out [Breitbart founder] Andrew's mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.\"[75]\nOn August 17, 2016, with 88 days until the 2016 presidential election, Bannon was appointed chief executive of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.[76] Bannon left Breitbart, as well as the Government Accountability Institute[61] and Cambridge Analytica,[77] to take the job. Shortly after he assumed the chief executive role, the chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, was dismissed.[68][69][78][79][80]\nOn November 13, following Donald Trump's election to the presidency, Bannon was appointed chief strategist and senior counselor to the President-elect.[81] His appointment drew opposition from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republican strategists because of statements in Breitbart News that were alleged to be racist or antisemitic.[22][23][82][83][84] A number of prominent conservative Jews, however, defended Bannon against the allegations of anti-Semitism, including Ben Shapiro,[84][85][86] David Horowitz,[87] Pamela Geller,[88] Bernard Marcus of the Republican Jewish Coalition,[89] Morton Klein[90] and the Zionist Organization of America,[89] and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.[91]\nAlan Dershowitz at first defended Bannon, saying there was no evidence he was antisemitic,[92][93] but then in a later piece stated that Bannon had made bigoted statements against Muslims, women, and others.[94] The ADL stated \"We are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements from Bannon.\"[95] Shapiro, who previously worked as an editor-at-large at Breitbart, said he had no evidence of Bannon being racist or an antisemite, but that Bannon was \"happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into European far-right nationalist populism\".[96] Bannon had referred to French National Front (now National Rally) politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen as \"the new rising star\".[97]\nOn November 15, 2016, U.S. Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island released a letter to Trump signed by 169 Democratic House Representatives urging the President-Elect to rescind his appointment of Bannon. The letter stated that appointing Bannon \"sends a disturbing message about what kind of president Donald Trump wants to be\",[98][99][100] because his \"ties to the White Nationalist movement have been well documented\"; it went on to present several examples of Breitbart News' alleged xenophobia.[101] Bannon denied being a white nationalist and claimed, rather, that he was an \"economic nationalist.\"[102]\nOn November 18, during his first interview not conducted by Breitbart Media since the 2016 presidential election, Bannon remarked on some criticisms made about him, saying, \"Darkness is good: Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power. It only helps us when they get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing.\"[103][104] The quote was published widely in the media.[103][105][106][107]\nIn an interview with The New York Times in late November, Trump responded to the controversy over Bannon's appointment, saying, \"I've known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right, or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him.\"[108]\nIn an interview with BBC Newsnight, Bannon said that his role in was to \"recalibrate\" the campaign which had at that point lost its message. He \"stepped in and got the campaign refocused\", but he rebuffed the idea that he was the reason Trump won the presidency, saying \"Trump is unique in American political history, he's his own closer\". But that his role was to make sure that Hilary Clinton was held up as a \"guardian of a corrupt and incompetent establishment\" and this that was key to winning votes in states that Trump needed to win.  [109]\nReuters reported on October 31, 2018 that the Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting a \"wide-ranging\" investigation of Bannon's activities during the campaign, including knowledge he may have had about any contacts between Russia and two campaign advisors, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, as well as his role with Cambridge Analytica.[110]\nUpon his inauguration, Trump appointed Bannon to be his Chief Strategist, a newly created position. The title made him a senior advisor to the president, nearly equivalent in authority to the Chief of Staff.[111] As a staff member in the Executive Office of the President, the position did not require Senate confirmation.[112] Breitbart News editor Julia Hahn followed Bannon to the White House, where she was appointed as Bannon's aide, as well as Special Assistant to President Trump.[113]\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in the aftermath of the 2016 election, Bannon analogized his influence to that of \"Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors\".[114][115][116]\nSeveral days after Donald Trump's inauguration, Bannon told The New York Times, \"The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. I want you to quote this: the media here is the opposition party. They don't understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\"[117]\nBannon, along with Stephen Miller, was involved in the creation of Executive Order 13769, which resulted in restricted U.S. travel and immigration by individuals from seven countries, suspension of the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days, and indefinite suspension of the entry of Syrians to the United States.[118][119] According to The Economist, a British news magazine, Bannon and Miller \"see Mr [Vladimir] Putin as a fellow nationalist and crusader against cosmopolitanism.\"[120]\nIn February 2017, Bannon appeared on the cover of Time, on which he was labeled \"the Great Manipulator\".[121] The headline used for the associated article was \"Is Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?\", alluding to Bannon's perceived influence in the White House.[122]\nIn a March 14, 2019 hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross was questioned about his conversations regarding the adding of a citizenship question to the 2020 census surveys, which he had with Bannon, who in turn had referred him to immigration hardliners Kris Kobach and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Missouri Democratic Representative Lacy Clay accused Ross of being  \"complicit\" regarding his efforts to weaken minority group voting rights, additionally accusing him of committing perjury with respect to those contacts. Clay called for Ross to tender his resignation, saying, \"You lied to Congress. You misled the American people and you are complicit in the Trump administration's intent to suppress the growing political power of the non-white population.\" Ross said the change was in response to a request by the Justice Department for statistics to protect voting rights.[123] On April 23, 2019, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments regarding appeals of rejections by three circuit courts of the proposed inclusion of the survey question.[124]\nIt was reported that he intentionally published stories to undermine H.R. McMaster. Bannon allegedly did this by leaking information to the alternative media, including alt-right writer Mike Cernovich.[125][126] It was also reported that the Trump administration retroactively granted Bannon a blanket exemption from federal ethics rules that allowed him to communicate with editors at Breitbart News,[127] which according to former Breitbart consultant Kurt Bardella would be proof of the administration's intent to allow him to continue being \"the de facto editorial director of Breitbart\".[128]\nAt the end of January 2017, in a departure from the previous format of the National Security Council (NSC), the holder of Bannon's position, along with that of the Chief of Staff, were designated by presidential memorandum as regular attendees to the NSC's Principals Committee, a Cabinet-level senior inter-agency forum for considering national security issues.[129][130] The enacted arrangement was criticized by several members of previous administrations and was called \"stone cold crazy\" by Susan E. Rice, Barack Obama's last national security adviser.[131] In response, White House spokesman Sean Spicer pointed to Bannon's seven years experience as a Navy officer in justifying his presence on the Committee.[132]\nBannon was removed from his NSC role in early April 2017 in a reorganization by U.S. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, whom Bannon had helped select.[133] Some White House officials said Bannon's main purpose in serving on the committee was as a check against former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned in February 2017 for misleading the vice president about a conversation with the Russian ambassador to the United States.[134][135] Hence, with Flynn gone, Bannon was no longer needed.[133] Bannon reportedly opposed his removal from the council and threatened to quit if president Trump went forward with it, although Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer urged him to stay.[4] The White House said Bannon had not attempted to leave, and Bannon said any indication that he threatened resignation was \"total nonsense\".[136] Bannon only attended one NSC meeting.[137]\nBannon's employment in the White House ended on August 18, 2017, less than a week after the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally which degenerated into violence and acrimony. Whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'\".[138] The decision to blame \"many sides\" was reported to have come from Bannon.[139] The NAACP released a statement saying that while they \"acknowledge and appreciate President Trump's disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today\", they called on Trump \"to take the tangible step to remove Steve Bannon\u00a0\u2013 a well-known white supremacist leader\u00a0\u2013 from his team of advisers\". The statement further described Bannon as a \"symbol of white nationalism\" who \"energized that sentiment\" through his current position within the White House.[140][141]\nSome sources stated that White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly asked Bannon on August 18, 2017, to submit his immediate resignation in lieu of being fired.[142] Bannon, however, stated he was not fired but rather submitted his two-week resignation notice on August 4, 2017.[143] He reminded The Weekly Standard that he had joined then-presidential candidate Trump's campaign on August 14, 2016, and said he'd \"always planned on spending one year,\" but that he stayed a few more days due to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.[144]\nIn an official statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \"John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.\"[145][146][147]\nThe same day, Breitbart News announced that Bannon would return to the site as executive chairman.[73] Several weeks after his departure it was reported that Trump still called Bannon using his personal cell phone, and was only calling when chief of staff Kelly was not around.[148] The Washington Post reported in October 2017 that Trump and Bannon remained in regular contact.[149]\nAfter leaving the White House, Bannon declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement.\"[27] Accordingly, he has supported many national populist conservative political movements around the world. These include France's National Front (now the National Rally),[150] Hungary's Fidesz,[151] the Italian League,[152] the Five Star Movement,[153] the Brothers of Italy,[154] Alternative for Germany,[155] the Polish Law and Justice,[156] the Sweden Democrats,[157] the Dutch Party for Freedom,[158] the Freedom Party of Austria,[159] the Swiss People's Party,[160] the UK Independence Party,[161] the Flemish Vlaams Belang,[162] the Belgian People's Party,[162]  Spain's Vox,[163] the Finns Party,[162] the UK Conservative Party,[164][165][166][167][168] the pan-European identitarian movement,[169] Republika Srpska's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats,[170] the Brazilian 2018 Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign,[171] and the Israeli Likud.[172]  Bannon believes that these movements\u00a0\u2013 along with Japan's Shinzo Abe, India's Narendra Modi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Saudi Arabia's Mohammad bin Salman, China's Xi Jinping, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and America's Donald Trump, as well as similar leaders in Egypt, the Philippines, Poland, and South Korea\u00a0\u2013 are part of a global shift towards nationalism.[173][174][175]\nIn October 2019, Bannon began co-hosting War Room: Impeachment a daily radio show and podcast to nudge the White House and its allies into taking a more focused and aggressive posture to counteract the Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.\n[176]\nIn November 2019, Bannon was compelled to testify in the trial of Roger Stone. Bannon testified that Stone was the wikileaks access point for the Trump campaign, to establish that Stone lied to Congress. Stone was subsequently convicted on all charges.[177][178]\nBannon has made efforts to unseat incumbent Republican members of Congress he deemed to be insufficiently supportive of Trump's agenda.[179][180][181] In October Bannon said he planned to sponsor primary challenges against six of the seven incumbent Republican senators in the 2018 elections. He said he had two requirements for a candidate to earn his support: they must pledge to vote against Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader and to end the Senate filibuster.[182]\nBannon received credit for helping Roy Moore defeat incumbent Senator Luther Strange in the September Republican primary for the 2017 special Alabama Senate election, despite Trump's having endorsed Strange.[183] After nine women alleged sexual misconduct, Bannon doubled down on his support for the candidate, raising doubt about the veracity of the accusations.[184] When Ivanka Trump condemned Moore's campaign in Alabama, saying \"there's a special place in hell for people who prey on children\", Bannon responded, \"What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?\", in reference to a woman who accused Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein of raping her at that age. (In August 2018, the New York Post alleged that Bannon was then trying to restore Epstein's favor for financial gain.[185])\nIn what had been considered a safe Republican seat, Moore lost in the special senate election on December 12, 2017. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was questioned by Republican commentators.[25]\nIn January 2018, upon the publication of Michael Wolff's widely discredited[186][187][188][189][190] book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which attributed many controversial and inflammatory statements to Bannon, Bannon and Trump became estranged and were widely seen as enemies.[191][192] The book quoted Bannon as saying that Ivanka Trump was \"as dumb as a brick\";[24] that the meeting among Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and agents of Russia was \"treasonous\";[193] and that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller would cause Donald Trump Jr. to \"crack like an egg on live television\".[194] Bannon also warned that investigators would likely uncover money laundering involving Jared Kushner and his family business loans from Deutsche Bank.[195]\nTrump promptly disavowed Bannon, saying that Bannon \"lost his mind\" when he left the White House, and attacking him in multiple angry statements.[196][197] In a tweet on the evening of January 4, 2018, Trump referred to Bannon as \"Sloppy Steve\";[198] two days later, he alleged in another tweet that Bannon had \"cried when he got fired and begged for his job.\"[199] On January 7, 2018, Bannon expressed regret over his delayed response, declared his \"unwavering\" support for Trump and his agenda, and praised Donald Trump Jr.[200] Bannon said his remarks about the campaign meeting were aimed at Manafort instead of Trump Jr., a claim which Wolff contested.[201]\nBecause of the break with Trump, Bannon's position as head of Breitbart News was called into question by Breitbart's owners,[26][202] and on January 9 it was announced that he had stepped down as executive chairman.[74]\nIn his 2019 book Siege, Wolff wrote, \u201cTrump was vulnerable because for 40 years he had run what increasingly seemed to resemble a semi-criminal enterprise,\u201d then quoted Bannon as saying, \u201cI think we can drop the 'semi' part.\u201d Wolff wrote that Bannon predicted investigations into Trump's finances would be his political downfall, quoting Bannon as saying \"This is where it isn't a witch hunt \u2013 even for the hard core, this is where he turns into just a crooked business guy, and one worth $50 million instead of $10 billion. Not the billionaire he said he was, just another scumbag.\"[203]\nIn August 2018, Bannon met with Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, and served as informal advisor to the Bolsonaro campaign in the Brazilian presidential elections that year.[171] In February 2019, the younger Bolsonaro joined Bannon's organization The Movement as its representative in South America.[204][205] In March 2019, Bannon met with both Bolsonaros in Washington, D.C.[206]\nBannon told journalist Michael Lewis in February 2018, \"We got elected on Drain the Swamp, Lock Her Up, Build a Wall. This was pure anger. Anger and fear is what gets people to the polls.\" He added, \"The Democrats don't matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\"[207]\nA self-described economic nationalist, Bannon advocates for reductions in immigration[208] and restrictions on free trade with China and Mexico.[209][210] Bannon is a skeptic of military intervention abroad and has opposed proposals for the expansion of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan,[211] Syria,[212] and Venezuela.[213] He has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel. He has been described as a white nationalist, but rejects the description.[214]\nBannon is in favor of raising federal income taxes to 44% for those earning incomes over $5 million a year as a way to pay for middle class tax cuts.[215] He also supports significantly increasing spending on infrastructure, describing himself as \"the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan\".[216] Bannon is opposed to government bailouts, describing them as \"socialism for the very wealthy\".[217] He generally believes in reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, declaring at the Conservative Political Action Conference he favored the \"deconstruction of the administrative state\".[218] However, he does support increased regulation of Internet companies like Facebook and Google, which he regards as akin to utilities in the modern age.[219] He opposed the merger between Time-Warner and AT&amp;T on antitrust grounds.[220] He was a strong opponent of the Paris climate agreement within the administration, successfully persuading the President to withdraw from it.[221]\nHe is generally skeptical of military intervention abroad, opposing proposals for the expansion of U.S. involvement in the War in Afghanistan,[211] the Syrian Civil War,[212] and the crisis in Venezuela.[213]\nIn Afghanistan, he supported a proposal by Erik Prince for the deployment of private military contractors instead of the U.S. military.[222] He believes \"there is no military solution\" to the 2017 North Korea crisis.[209]\nBannon has described U.S. allies in Europe, the Persian Gulf, the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca, as well as South Korea and Japan, as having become \"protectorates of the United States\" that do not \"make an effort to defend [themselves]\", and believes NATO members should pay a minimum of 2% of GDP on defense.[223]\nHe also supports repairing United States-Russia relations and opposes upgrading the U.S. nuclear arsenal.[224]\nBannon strongly favors U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal,[225] and was supportive of the approach taken by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis[226] and the 2017 Saudi Arabian purge.[citation needed] He believes Qatar is \"no less dangerous\" than North Korea.[227]\nBannon believes Iran, Turkey and China are forming a \"new axis\" to challenge the West,[228] and has described Turkey as \"the greatest danger facing the United States\" and \"far more dangerous than Iran\".[227]\nBannon reportedly speaks often with Trump donor Sheldon Adelson, and has been alarmed at a push for a renewed Middle East peace process.[229] He has described Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as a \"terrorist\".[230] He has advocated giving the land in the West Bank to Jordan and in Gaza to Egypt.[231]\nAlthough Bannon initially favored the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL) in the United Kingdom,[232] he later backed the UK Independence Party (UKIP).[161]\nNigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP, once presented Bannon with a portrait of Bannon dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte.[233] Bannon has encouraged Farage to return as leader of UKIP.[234]\nAfter former EDL leader Tommy Robinson was sentenced to 13 months in prison for contempt of court, Bannon has called for his release, describing Robinson as the \"backbone\" of Britain.[235]\nBannon has also called for a revolt in the United Kingdom should the country adopt a soft Brexit, stating, \"If I was in middle England and said this wasn't what I voted for I would rise up and make sure the guys in parliament knew it.\" When asked whether this should be interpreted as a \"call to arms\", he replied: \"Absolutely\".[235]\nBannon has met with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prospective candidate for the leadership of the country's Conservative Party,[236] describing him as \"one of the best thinkers in the conservative movement on a global basis.\"[237]\nBannon also urged current British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another potential leadership contender, who Bannon said in July 2018 that he had known \"over the last year\" and was \"very impressed\" with, to challenge then-Prime Minister Theresa May.[238][239] According to a Buzzfeed News report, Bannon was in private contact with Johnson during his visit to Britain that month, and the two men were previously in text communication during their respective tenures as White House Chief Strategist and British Foreign Secretary.[240]\nBannon gave a talk at the Institute for Human Dignity, a conservative catholic group based in Rome, at a  Vatican meeting in 2014 via Skype from Los Angeles.[241] He expressed a belief that traditionalists see Russia as an ally. Bannon said they \"believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism\u2014and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country. They want to see nationalism for their country\" rather than a \"pan-European Union\".[242] Bannon, wrote Isobel Thompson in Vanity Fair in July 2018, \"has been busy cultivating a new generation of nativist, pro-Russian leaders in Europe to invert the continent's current liberal-democratic orientation\".[242] However, in the 2014 speech, Bannon insisted: \"I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy.\"[241]\nIn July 2018, Bannon announced plans to launch a new political operation beginning with an attempt to unite populist parties across Europe before the 2019 European Parliament election. With the project to be based in Brussels, he indicated he would spend 50% of his time in Europe from the following November working at locations throughout the continent.[243] Bannon formed a foundation around 2018 for nationalist parties called The Movement.[244]\nBannon is supportive of European right-wing populist national conservative movements such as the Hungarian Fidesz, the French National Front (now National Rally), the Spanish Vox, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany, the Italian Northern League, the Brothers of Italy, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Sweden Democrats, the Finns Party, the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Belgian People's Party, the Polish National Movement, and the Swiss People's Party.[154][157][161][162][245][246][247][248]\nBannon has also praised the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party government of Narendra Modi in India,[249] and Shinzo Abe's Liberal Democratic Party government in Japan.[250]\nBannon called Chinese people \"the salt of the earth \u2014 hardworking, decent, family-oriented\", but he believes that Xi Jinping's communist regime in Beijing presents \"the greatest existential danger\" ever to the United States \"because we have never faced an opponent with the scale and ambitions of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party\".[251] Bannon criticized China's construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea.[251]\nIn his talk delivered to a small conference in the Vatican during 2014, Bannon said: \"If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places ... it bequeathed to us the great institution that is the church of the West\".[252] He is reputed to believe Putin's Russia and Trump's America are Christian allies against the Islamic State and \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d.[253][254][255]\nBannon's political and economic views have been described by others as nationalist,[256] right-wing populist,[257] and paleoconservative.[258] He self-identifies as a conservative.[78][259][260] He rejects allegations that he is a white nationalist,[214] calling white nationalists \"losers\", a \"fringe element\", and a \"collection of clowns\",[209] and describing white supremacist Richard Spencer as a \"self promoting freak\" and a \"goober\".[261]\nAt a party congress in March 2018, Bannon gave members of the French right-wing populist National Front (NF) what has been described as a \"populist pep talk\".[150] Bannon advised the party members to \"Let them call you racist, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it like a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker. ... History is on our side and will bring us victory.\"  Bannon's remarks brought the members to their feet.[262][263][264][265] Critics expressed concern that Bannon was \"normalizing racism.\"[266] Bannon generally considers charges of racism made against the right to be the result of a biased media.[267]\nDonald Trump has previously referred to Bannon as \"more of a libertarian than anything else\",[268] although at least one libertarian commentator has disputed this claim.[269] Bannon has been described as a \"policy intellectual\".[270]\nBannon often describes himself as an economic nationalist, criticizing crony capitalism, Austrian economics, and the Objectivist capitalism of Ayn Rand, which he believes seeks to \"make people commodities, and to objectify people.\"[214][271][272][273] However, he has also stated that he generally considers himself a free market capitalist, believing it to be \"the underpinnings of our society\", while noting that he believes America is \"more than an economy\".[223] He has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel.[274][275][276]\nBannon's strategic thinking has been influenced by Neil Howe's and William Strauss's Fourth Turning theory, which proposes that \"populism, nationalism and state-run authoritarianism would soon be on the rise, not just in America but around the world. [... Once one strips] away the extraneous accidents and technology, you are left with only a limited number of social moods, which tend to recur in a fixed order. [...] Forests need periodic fires; rivers need periodic floods. Societies, too.\"[277] The book is said to have been a major influence on Bannon's film Generation Zero.[278]\nA former practitioner of Zen meditation, and a nominal Roman Catholic,[279] Bannon's political thinking has been influenced by the politics of American populism exemplified by Andrew Jackson, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, James K. Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, and Trump; by Pope Pius XI's socio-political philosophy of subsidiarity, as expressed in the 1931 papal encyclical, Quadragesimo anno, defending that political matters ought to be handled by the lowest, least centralized competent authority; and by Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non's Traditionalism, extolling the social efficacy of spiritual ideas transmitted by \"primordial\" faith traditions such as Vedanta, Buddhism, Sufism, and medieval Christianity, which it argued were under attack by Western secularism. Bannon was particularly influenced by the  Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita and the ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War.[280][281] Bannon has also cited Alexander Dugin's Russian nationalist variant of Traditionalism called Eurasianism.[282][283]\nLebanese-American author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, neoreactionary blogger Curtis Yarvin and conservative intellectual Michael Anton have been pointed out as three of the main influences in Steve Bannon's political thinking.[278][284] Bannon is an admirer of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan.[285] Bannon's favorite columnist is academic Walter Russell Mead.[286] Political theorist and philosopher Edmund Burke has also been described as a major influence on Bannon's ideological outlook.[287] In a 2014 speech to a Vatican conference, Bannon made a passing reference to Julius Evola, a twentieth-century, Nazi-linked Italian writer who influenced Benito Mussolini's Italian Fascism and promoted the Traditionalist School, described by a New York Times writer as \"a worldview popular in far-right and alternative religious circles that believes progress and equality are poisonous illusions.\" Bannon's interest in the ideas of the Traditionalist School was driven by Evola's book Revolt Against the Modern World, and Gu\u00e9non's books Man and his Becoming according to the Vedanta and The Crisis of the Modern World.[288] In March 2016, Bannon stated he appreciates \"any piece that mentions Evola.\"[289] In referring to the associated views of Vladimir Putin, who is influenced by Evola follower Dugin, Bannon stated \"We, the Judeo-Christian West, really have to look at what he's talking about as far as Traditionalism goes\u00a0\u2014 particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism.\"[290] He has likewise quoted French anti-Enlightenment writer Charles Maurras approvingly to a French diplomat.[291][292] Bannon has also repeatedly referenced the controversial French novel The Camp of the Saints (1973) by Jean Raspail, which depicts Third World immigration destroying Western civilization.[293] He has embraced what BBC News describes as Savitri Devi's \"account of history as a cyclical battle between good and evil\".[294] Bannon told an interviewer in 2018 that he is \"fascinated by Mussolini\", noting: \"He was clearly loved by women. He was a guy's guy. He has all that virility. He also had amazing fashion sense, right, that whole thing with the uniforms.\"[295]\nGerman film director Leni Riefenstahl, who produced propaganda films for the regime in Nazi Germany, is said to have influenced Bannon's film-making techniques, with Bannon once describing himself to writing colleague Julia Jones as the \"Riefenstahl of George Bush\", modifying the ending as \"the GOP\" when Jones was horrified.[296] The opening of Bannon's documentary film The Hope &amp; The Change (2012) consciously imitated Riefenstahl's film The Triumph of the Will (1935), which depicted the Nuremberg Rally held in 1934.[297]\nAccording to The Guardian (London) in January 2018, Bannon's ideology is substantially similar to that of Stephen Miller, Tucker Carlson, Benny Johnson, Raheem Kassam and Matthew Boyle, the latter two having been prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Bannon at Breitbart.[298]\nBannon has been married and divorced three times. He has three adult daughters. His first marriage was to Cathleen Suzanne Houff.[299] Bannon and Houff had a daughter, Maureen, in 1988 and subsequently divorced.[82][300]\nBannon's second marriage was to Mary Louise Piccard, a former investment banker, in April 1995. Their twin daughters were born three days after the wedding. Piccard filed for dissolution of their marriage in 1997.[301][302]\n\nBannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery, and dissuading a witness in early January 1996 after Piccard accused Bannon of domestic abuse. The Santa Monica Police Department crime report states that after Piccard called 911, an officer arrived at their home and observed red marks on Piccard's wrist and neck.[303] The charges were later dropped when Piccard did not appear in court.[304] In an article in The New York Times Piccard stated her absence was due to threats made to her by Bannon and his lawyer: Mr. Bannon, she said, told her that \"if I went to court, he and his attorney would make sure that I would be the one who was guilty\" ... Mr. Bannon's lawyer, she said, \"threatened me,\" telling her that if Mr. Bannon went to jail, she \"would have no money and no way to support the children.\" ... Mr. Bannon's lawyer ... denied pressuring her not to testify.[305]Piccard and Bannon divorced in 1997. During the divorce proceedings, Piccard alleged that Bannon had made antisemitic remarks about her choice of schools, saying he did not want to send his children to The Archer School for Girls because there were too many Jews at the school, and Jews raise their children to be \"whiny brats\". Bannon's spokesperson denied the accusation, noting that he had chosen to send both his children to the Archer School.[304][306][307][308][309]\nBannon's third marriage was to Diane Clohesy; they married in 2006 and divorced in 2009.[310][311]\nBannon has been a producer, writer or director on the following films and documentaries:\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nNancy Patricia Pelosi (/p\u0259\u02c8lo\u028asi/; n\u00e9e\u00a0D'Alesandro; born March 26, 1940) is an American Democratic Party politician serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since January 2019. She is the first woman in U.S. history to hold this position. As such, and having first been elected to Congress in 1987, Pelosi is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history.[2] As Speaker of the House, she is second in the presidential line of succession, immediately after the vice president.[3] As of 2019, Pelosi is in her 17th term as a congresswoman. She represents California's 12th congressional district, which consists of four fifths of the city and county of San Francisco. She initially represented the 5th district (1987\u20131993), and then, when district boundaries were redrawn after the 1990 Census, the 8th district (1993\u20132013). She has led House Democrats since 2003\u2014being the first woman to lead a party in Congress\u2014serving twice each as House minority leader (2003\u20132007 and 2011\u20132019, when Republicans held the majority), and as Speaker (2007\u20132011 and 2019\u2013present, during periods of Democratic majority). Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush Administration's 2005 attempt to partially privatize Social Security. During her first speakership, she was instrumental in the passage of many landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Pelosi lost the speakership in January 2011, after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. However, she retained her role as leader of the House Democratic Caucus and returned to the role of House minority leader. In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats won back control of the House.[4] Afterward, when the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Pelosi was again elected speaker,[5] becoming the first former speaker to return to the post since Sam Rayburn in 1955.[6] On September 24, 2019, Pelosi announced the commencement of impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump.[7][8] On January 10, 2020, she announced that she would end the impasse and alerted the House that she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate the following week.[9] Pelosi was born in Baltimore to an Italian-American family. She was the only girl and the youngest of seven children of Annunciata M. \"Nancy\" D'Alesandro (n\u00e9e Lombardi)[10] and Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.,[11] who both had Italian roots.[11] Her mother was born in Campobasso,[10] in South Italy, and her father could trace his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo.[11] When Nancy was born, her father was a Democratic Congressman from Maryland and he became Mayor of Baltimore seven years later.[11][12][13] Pelosi's mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter the value of social networking.[2] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was Mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971.[14] Pelosi was involved with politics from an early age. She helped her father at his campaign events. She attended John F. Kennedy's inaugural address when he was sworn in as U.S. president in January 1961.[11] She graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.[15] Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House majority leader Steny Hoyer.[16] After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th District congressman Phillip Burton, and began working her way up in Democratic politics. In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996. She was elected as party chair for Northern California in January 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983.[17] Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.[18] Phillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala. In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.[19] Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987; Pelosi took office a week later.[20][21] Pelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and Republicans, who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won reelection in the regular election in 1988 and has been reelected another 16 times with no substantive opposition, winning with an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross.[22] The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2016 when Preston Picus polled 19.1% and Pelosi won with 80.9%.[23] For the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, she held the distinction of contributing the most among members of Congress to other congressional campaigns, in part because she is in a safe district and does not need the campaign funds.[24] In the House, she served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees, and was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee until her election as minority leader.[25] Pelosi is a member of the House Baltic Caucus.[26] In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.[27] In 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in the House.[28] In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats.[29] The change in control meant as House minority leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker of the House in the next Congress.[30][31] On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously chose Pelosi as the Democratic candidate for speaker.[32] Pelosi supported her longtime friend, John Murtha of Pennsylvania, for the position of House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[33] Pelosi and Hoyer had a somewhat frosty relationship dating back to 2001, when they ran against each other for minority whip. However, Hoyer was elected as House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149\u201386 within the caucus.[34] On January 3, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio with 233 votes compared to his 202 votes in the election for speaker of the House.[35] Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi and her longtime friend John Dingell of Michigan swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.[36][37] With her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She is also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi. During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of speaker: This is a historic moment\u2014for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.[39] She also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress, while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs: The election of 2006 was a call to change\u2014not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.[39] As speaker, Pelosi was still the leader of the House Democrats; the speaker is considered to be the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had every right to do so as a full House member. She was also not a member of any House committees. Pelosi was re-elected speaker in 2009. A CBS News poll conducted in March 2010 found that 37% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Speaker Pelosi, with 11% approving.[40] According to a March 2010 Rasmussen national poll, 64% of voters viewed the speaker unfavorably, and 29% favorably.[41] During and after her tenure as speaker, Pelosi was perceived as a contentious political figure, with Republican candidates frequently trying to tie their Democratic opponents to Pelosi and with moderate Democrats seeking to show their moderate bona fides by expressing opposition to Pelosi.[42][43][44][45][46] Shortly after winning re-election, President George W. Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[47] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to Bush's proposal, and subsequent defeat of the proposed plan.[48][49] In the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant. In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional elections\u2014which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994\u2014Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was \"off the table\". (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, \"you never know where\" investigations might lead.)[50] After becoming speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[51] Prior to the U.S. 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress's term.[52][53] The origin for the name \"first hundred hours\" is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the Great Depression) during his \"first hundred days\" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the Contract with America. On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter: [T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain.\u00a0... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror.[54] Pelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[55] Pelosi has been credited for spearheading President Obama's health-care law when it seemed it would go down in defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy's former senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, thereby causing the Senate Democrats to lose their filibuster proof majority, Obama agreed with then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea that he should do smaller initiatives which could pass easily. Pelosi, however, dismissed the president's fear and instead mocked his scaled-back ideas as \"kiddie care\".[56] After convincing the president this would be their only shot at health-care because of the large Democratic majorities they currently had, she rallied her Democratic caucus as she began an \"unbelievable marathon\" of a two-month session to craft the health-care bill, which successfully passed the House with a 219\u2013212 vote. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he specifically credited Pelosi as being \"one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had\".[57][58][59] Though Pelosi was re-elected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and ceded control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After the electoral setback suffered by her party, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus in the position of minority leader, the office she held prior to becoming speaker. After Pelosi's disparate intra-party opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[60] Pelosi was elected minority leader for the 112th Congress. On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced she would remain on as Democratic leader.[61] In November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report \"a right-wing smear\".[62][63][64] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, Pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they \"shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all\".[65][66] In August 2016, Pelosi said her personal contact information was posted online following a cyber attack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received \"obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages\". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.[67] Tim Ryan initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016, prompted by colleagues following the 2016 presidential election.[68] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[69] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134\u201363 on November 30.[70] In 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. On June 22, 2017, a small group of House Democrats held a closed-door meeting in the office of Representative Kathleen Rice (NY) to discuss a strategy for selecting new Democratic leadership.[71] Rice publicly called for new Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives, as did other House Democrats, including Tim Ryan (OH), Seth Moulton (MA), and Filemon Vela (TX).[72] Cedric Richmond (LA), Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also attended the closed-door meeting on Pelosi. Rice said in a CNN interview about Pelosi's leadership, \"If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.\"[72] In a press conference, Pelosi responded to the criticism by saying, \"I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.\"[72] When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, Pelosi responded, \"Well, I'm a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do.\"[73][74] In November 2017, after Pelosi called for the resignation of John Conyers over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. Pelosi said Congress had \"a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace\".[75] In February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Ryan accusing Republicans with having waged a \"cover-up campaign\" to protect Trump and cited last minute changes to the memo after a vote for its release as dangerous and violating House rules, saying, \"House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.\"[76] She charged House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes with partaking in \"deliberately dishonest actions\" and called for his immediate removal from his position.[77] In February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest speech in the House of Representatives when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers\u2014individuals who were brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants\u2014to object to a budget deal which would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, which were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.[78][79][80] In May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign,[81] Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[82] In August 2018, Pelosi called for the resignation of Duncan D. Hunter after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying in a statement that the charges were \"evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today\".[83] In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats regained a majority of seats in the House. On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker of the House.[84] She was formally re-elected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi \"clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job\". Two hundred twenty House Democrats voted to elect Pelosi speaker, while 15 other House Democrats cast their ballots for someone else or voted present.[85] At the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed President Trump's attempts to use the 2018\u201319 federal government shutdown (which she called a \"hostage-taking\" of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the American border.[86] Pelosi declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House of Representatives chamber while the shutdown was ongoing.[87][88] After several news polls showed Trump's popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, he signed a January 25 resolution reopening the federal government without any concessions regarding a border wall or other issues.[89] Analysts and commentators widely called the event \"the most humiliating loss of his presidency\".[90][91] Having successfully impeached President Trump on December 18, 2019, and on the eve of his trial before the U.S. Senate, the Washington Post political writer, Paul Kane, called her the most powerful House speaker in, at least, twenty-five years and noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas.[92] Pelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader.[93] The American Civil Liberties Union's Congressional Scorecard has given Pelosi a lifetime rating of 92% for her voting record on civil liberties.[94] In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[95] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[96] Pelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[97] In June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.[98] In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a deal with the devil and noted she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.[99] Pelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[100] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage.[101][102][103] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the \"historic decision\". She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[104] The LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign gave Pelosi a 100% rating in 2006 for her voting record in the 107th through 109th congresses (2001\u20132006), indicating that she voted favorably on legislation supported by the organization on every occasion.[105] In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said \"My religion compels me\u2014and I love it for it\u2014to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it's unconstitutional on top of that.\"[106] Pelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposes Trump's transgender military ban.[107] Pelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML's deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress hadn't done anything to change the laws.[108] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[109] Pelosi supports the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.[110] As speaker of the House, Pelosi quietly moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt.[111] In Lee's place, she had a statue of Rosa Parks erected.[111] In August 2017, Pelosi said she supported the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials from the Capitol Building.[112] In 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah.[113][114][115] After the briefing, Pelosi said she \"was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal\".[116] Two unnamed former Bush Administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she didn't raise substantial objections.[117] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, \"In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.'\"[118] These techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi's office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[119] Subsequently, several top Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging that CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a \"number of years\" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[120] Neither letter, lawmakers or the CIA provided details and the circumstances surrounding the allegations make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[121] Officials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs.[122] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said, \"In that or any other briefing\u00a0... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel\u2014the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\"[113][123] Pelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by the House by a 300\u2013132 vote, but in the Senate fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required (with 65 out of 100 Senators voting in favor).[124] As speaker of the House, she also spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The Act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but as part of HR 2206 it was included. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by the exclusion of the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[125] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, prior to Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[126] Pelosi opposed the welfare reform proposed by President Bush as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[127] She also opposed the tax reform signed by President Trump in December 2017, describing it as \"probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America\u00a0... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich\u00a0... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.\"[128] She said \"this is Armageddon\" and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending.[129] In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill was passed, Pelosi was asked by a reporter to respond to statements by companies attributing the tax cuts for allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits that workers got equated to \"crumbs\".[130][131] Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses of significantly over a thousand.[132] In November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with President Trump on infrastructure development. Though he \"really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office\" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would \"create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions\".[133] On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer met with President Trump about infrastructure funding.[134] In late May a meeting to discuss an impending $2 trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when President Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.[135] In August 2018, after President Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi lauded the move as \"an important first step\" but requested the president adhere to a wish by California Governor Jerry Brown for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called for the Trump administration to take \"real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive\".[136] In 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools.[137] Pelosi voted for the No Child Left Behind Act,[138] which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[139][140] In 2019, Pelosi said climate change was \"the existential threat of our time\", and called for action to curb climate change.[141] Pelosi has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence upon foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[142] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[143][144] Pelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[145] Speaker Pelosi was instrumental in the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Pelosi was a key figure in convincing President Barack Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in a January special election, a defeat that was seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[58] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's signature health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[146] Pelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[147] She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders' bill for single payer healthcare.[148][149] On March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act but would also be willing to form a compromise measure in the event that Republicans were unable to pass a compromise bill and reached out for bipartisan support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.[150] In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called for lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to put pressure on Republicans in the health-care discussion. Pelosi said the Democrats would be unified as putting \"a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill\".[151] In July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said the goal of the Democrats \"has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits\u00a0... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.\"[152] In November 2018, after the Democrats gained a majority in the House following the 2018 midterm elections, Pelosi said, \"I'm staying as speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families and if Hillary had won, I could go home.\" She further stated that Republicans had misrepresented their prior position of being opposed to pre-existing conditions during the election cycle and called for Republicans to join Democrats in \"removing all doubt that the pre-existing medical condition is the law\u2014the benefit\u2014is the law of the land\".[153] Pelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[154] She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas (HA 209, rejected), in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision that forbids service women and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected), in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[154] In 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C. for being \"incorrect\" in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to come with a definition of when life begins. During the interview she said, \"over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.\"[155] In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy. In a January 25, 2009 interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said, \"Well, the family planning services reduce cost. They reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now and part of what we do for children's health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs. One of those\u2014one of the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception, will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government.\"[156] Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the \"Boldest possible move\" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabrielle Giffords.[157] In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association for her stances on gun control.[158] In February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans cowering to the gun lobby was \"an assault on our whole country\" and that the victims were \"paying the price for our inaction\". She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and noted Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.[159] In November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans \"deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets\" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.[160] With regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support such legislation.[161] In March 2009, the New York Post wrote that the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting that the United States Air Force (USAF) provide specific aircraft\u2014a Boeing 757\u2014for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[162][163][164] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested\u2014for security reasons\u2014that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said \"no one has rendered judgment\" that Pelosi's use of aircraft \"is excessive\".[165] During a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by Trump responding to the testimony of former FBI James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness.[166] In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[167] In January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance that was without serious policy ideas both parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump's refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them.[168] In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was \"a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people\" and \"part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president\" who had shown he had something to hide.[169] In March, Pelosi said she was \"more concerned about the president's policies which undermine the financial security of America's working families\" than the Stormy Daniels\u2013Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat.[170] In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon \"sends a troubling signal to the president's allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon \"poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy\".[171] On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was \"a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics\", and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration.[172] Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019.[173] In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the Leader of the Opposition Juan Guaid\u00f3 during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.[174] The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members, and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration.[175] In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy all subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.[176] On May 7, 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the Committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged \"Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment\",[177][178] described Trump's interference regarding McGahn's records as an obstruction of justice, stating that \"Trump is goading us to impeach him.\"[179][180] On May 22, 2019, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared, \"we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\"[181] Later that day, after learning of Pelosi's comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him.[182] Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of \"obstructing justice\" and again said he \"is engaged in a cover-up\".[182] On June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wants to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted.[183] In March 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet and called on \"freedom-loving people\" worldwide to denounce China. She said, \"The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world\", while addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India.[184] In October 2008, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its \"bold decision\" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia. Pelosi's statement read, \"I call on the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.\"[185] Pelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should \"shock the conscience of the world\".[186] Before the Trump Administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfill his own campaign commitments to label China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.[187][188][189][190] In September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Chinese media criticized Pelosi sharply for this meeting, accusing her of \"backing and encouraging radical activists\".[191] Pelosi publicly scolded Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had \"expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations\" of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[192] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.[193] In 2008, Pelosi said: \"For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges\u2014people to people exchanges with Cuba.\"[194] In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro's regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.[195] Pelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[127][196] In a February 15, 2007, interview Pelosi noted that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran \"and I take him at his word\". At the same time, she said, \"I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran\".[197] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[198] requiring that\u2014absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces\u2014the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[199] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007. In July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a \"very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran\" and called the deal \"a diplomatic masterpiece\".[200] In 2016, Pelosi argued against the passage of two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: \"Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.\"[201] In May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and \"particularly senseless, disturbing & dangerous\".[202] In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force against Iraq,[203] while stating that Iraq, like \"other countries of concern\", had WMDs.[204] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi noted that Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein's launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low. \"This is about the Constitution,\" Pelosi said. \"It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.\" While Pelosi opposed, Congress still passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States against Iraq.[205] Although Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.[206] Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.[207] Pelosi reaffirms that \"America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship\".[208] Pelosi emphasized that \"a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,\u00a0... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe.\" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.[209] Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli \"hopeful signs\" of offering land, while criticizing Palestinian \"threats\" of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, \"If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace\".[208] During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921 on the count that \"the seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond\". She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah \"have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent\". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border \"have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah\" in part for their use of \"civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas\".[210] In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the \"strong friendship\" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a \"symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel\".[211] Pelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[212] In March 2018 Pelosi said, \"There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.\"[213] In March 2019, she said, \"Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.\"[214] In January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution condemning the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.[215][216] Nancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.[217][218] In August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea \"will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were \"recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.\"[219] In November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea's nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to \"exhaust every other remedy\".[220] In June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, \"In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime's status quo.\"[221] In December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved \"a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack\" and \"America's democracy and national security\" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to \"fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks\".[222] In February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.[223] In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.[224] She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: \"Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital.\" She called for House Speaker Ryan to \"make clear that there is not\u2014and never will be\u2014an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.\"[225] Pelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that \"for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough\" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. \"If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.\"[226] Pelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.[227] She also favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[228] In January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump's announcement a \"Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin\".[229] In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump's deserting the US's \"Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman\" Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey and opined that the decision \"poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.\"[230] In mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[231] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.\u2013Turkey relations.[232] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[233] The resolution was passed during Pelosi's second term as a speaker. The house voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.[234] Pelosi's only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent,[19][235] then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1.[236] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 Census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only twice. She met Paul Frank Pelosi while she was attending college.[237] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[238] After the couple married, they moved to New York, and then to San Francisco in 1969, where Paul Pelosi's brother, Ronald Pelosi, was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[239] Nancy and Paul Pelosi have five children: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, as well as nine grandchildren.[240] Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[241] Pelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.[242][243] Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhome in Loomis, California.[244] The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) estimated in 2009 that Pelosi's average net worth was US$58,436,537, ranking her 13th among 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[245] In 2014, CRP reported Pelosi's average net worth in 2014 was US$101,273,023 having ranked 8th out of 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[246] Business Insider reported that Pelosi's worth was $26.4 million in 2012 and made her the 13th richest member of Congress.[247] In 2014, Roll Call estimated that Pelosi's net worth was $29.35 million, ranking her the 15th wealthiest member of Congress.[248] Roll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast, and Facebook. Roll Call reported that the Pelosis have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to Roll Call, Pelosi and her husband hold properties \"worth at least $14.65 million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5 million, and commercial real estate in San Francisco.\"[248] Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[249] She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation.",

She is the first woman in U.S. history to hold this position. As such, and having first been elected to Congress in 1987, Pelosi is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history.[2] As Speaker of the House, she is second in the presidential line of succession, immediately after the vice president.[3]\nAs of 2019, Pelosi is in her 17th term as a congresswoman. She represents California's 12th congressional district, which consists of four fifths of the city and county of San Francisco. She initially represented the 5th district (1987\u20131993), and then, when district boundaries were redrawn after the 1990 Census, the 8th district (1993\u20132013).\nShe has led House Democrats since 2003\u2014being the first woman to lead a party in Congress\u2014serving twice each as House minority leader (2003\u20132007 and 2011\u20132019, when Republicans held the majority), and as Speaker (2007\u20132011 and 2019\u2013present, during periods of Democratic majority).\nPelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush Administration's 2005 attempt to partially privatize Social Security. During her first speakership, she was instrumental in the passage of many landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act.\nPelosi lost the speakership in January 2011, after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. However, she retained her role as leader of the House Democratic Caucus and returned to the role of House minority leader. In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats won back control of the House.[4] Afterward, when the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Pelosi was again elected speaker,[5] becoming the first former speaker to return to the post since Sam Rayburn in 1955.[6] On September 24, 2019, Pelosi announced the commencement of impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump.[7][8] On January 10, 2020, she announced that she would end the impasse and alerted the House that she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate the following week.[9]\nPelosi was born in Baltimore to an Italian-American family. She was the only girl and the youngest of seven children of Annunciata M. \"Nancy\" D'Alesandro (n\u00e9e Lombardi)[10] and Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.,[11] who both had Italian roots.[11] Her mother was born in Campobasso,[10] in South Italy, and her father could trace his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo.[11] When Nancy was born, her father was a Democratic Congressman from Maryland and he became Mayor of Baltimore seven years later.[11][12][13] Pelosi's mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter the value of social networking.[2] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was Mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971.[14]\nPelosi was involved with politics from an early age. She helped her father at his campaign events. She attended John F. Kennedy's inaugural address when he was sworn in as U.S. president in January 1961.[11] She graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.[15] Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House majority leader Steny Hoyer.[16]\nAfter moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th District congressman Phillip Burton, and began working her way up in Democratic politics. In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996. She was elected as party chair for Northern California in January 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983.[17] Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.[18]\nPhillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala. In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.[19] Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987; Pelosi took office a week later.[20][21]\nPelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and Republicans, who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won reelection in the regular election in 1988 and has been reelected another 16 times with no substantive opposition, winning with an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross.[22] The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2016 when Preston Picus polled 19.1% and Pelosi won with 80.9%.[23]\nFor the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, she held the distinction of contributing the most among members of Congress to other congressional campaigns, in part because she is in a safe district and does not need the campaign funds.[24]\nIn the House, she served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees, and was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee until her election as minority leader.[25]\nPelosi is a member of the House Baltic Caucus.[26]\nIn 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.[27]\nIn 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in the House.[28]\nIn the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats.[29] The change in control meant as House minority leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker of the House in the next Congress.[30][31] On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously chose Pelosi as the Democratic candidate for speaker.[32]\nPelosi supported her longtime friend, John Murtha of Pennsylvania, for the position of House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[33] Pelosi and Hoyer had a somewhat frosty relationship dating back to 2001, when they ran against each other for minority whip. However, Hoyer was elected as House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149\u201386 within the caucus.[34]\nOn January 3, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio with 233 votes compared to his 202 votes in the election for speaker of the House.[35] Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi and her longtime friend John Dingell of Michigan swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.[36][37]\nWith her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She is also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.\nDuring her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of speaker:\nThis is a historic moment\u2014for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.[39]\nShe also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress, while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:\nThe election of 2006 was a call to change\u2014not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.[39]\nAs speaker, Pelosi was still the leader of the House Democrats; the speaker is considered to be the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had every right to do so as a full House member. She was also not a member of any House committees.\nPelosi was re-elected speaker in 2009.\nA CBS News poll conducted in March 2010 found that 37% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Speaker Pelosi, with 11% approving.[40] According to a March 2010 Rasmussen national poll, 64% of voters viewed the speaker unfavorably, and 29% favorably.[41]\nDuring and after her tenure as speaker, Pelosi was perceived as a contentious political figure, with Republican candidates frequently trying to tie their Democratic opponents to Pelosi and with moderate Democrats seeking to show their moderate bona fides by expressing opposition to Pelosi.[42][43][44][45][46]\nShortly after winning re-election, President George W. Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[47] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to Bush's proposal, and subsequent defeat of the proposed plan.[48][49]\nIn the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant.\nIn May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional elections\u2014which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994\u2014Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was \"off the table\". (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, \"you never know where\" investigations might lead.)[50]\nAfter becoming speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[51]\nPrior to the U.S. 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress's term.[52][53]\nThe origin for the name \"first hundred hours\" is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the Great Depression) during his \"first hundred days\" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the Contract with America.\nOn January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter:\n[T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain.\u00a0... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror.[54]\nPelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[55]\nPelosi has been credited for spearheading President Obama's health-care law when it seemed it would go down in defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy's former senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, thereby causing the Senate Democrats to lose their filibuster proof majority, Obama agreed with then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea that he should do smaller initiatives which could pass easily. Pelosi, however, dismissed the president's fear and instead mocked his scaled-back ideas as \"kiddie care\".[56] After convincing the president this would be their only shot at health-care because of the large Democratic majorities they currently had, she rallied her Democratic caucus as she began an \"unbelievable marathon\" of a two-month session to craft the health-care bill, which successfully passed the House with a 219\u2013212 vote. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he specifically credited Pelosi as being \"one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had\".[57][58][59]\nThough Pelosi was re-elected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and ceded control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After the electoral setback suffered by her party, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus in the position of minority leader, the office she held prior to becoming speaker. After Pelosi's disparate intra-party opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[60] Pelosi was elected minority leader for the 112th Congress. On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced she would remain on as Democratic leader.[61]\nIn November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report \"a right-wing smear\".[62][63][64] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, Pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they \"shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all\".[65][66]\nIn August 2016, Pelosi said her personal contact information was posted online following a cyber attack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received \"obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages\". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.[67]\nTim Ryan initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016, prompted by colleagues following the 2016 presidential election.[68] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[69] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134\u201363 on November 30.[70]\nIn 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. On June 22, 2017, a small group of House Democrats held a closed-door meeting in the office of Representative Kathleen Rice (NY) to discuss a strategy for selecting new Democratic leadership.[71] Rice publicly called for new Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives, as did other House Democrats, including Tim Ryan (OH), Seth Moulton (MA), and Filemon Vela (TX).[72] Cedric Richmond (LA), Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also attended the closed-door meeting on Pelosi.\nRice said in a CNN interview about Pelosi's leadership, \"If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.\"[72]\nIn a press conference, Pelosi responded to the criticism by saying, \"I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.\"[72] When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, Pelosi responded, \"Well, I'm a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do.\"[73][74]\nIn November 2017, after Pelosi called for the resignation of John Conyers over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. Pelosi said Congress had \"a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace\".[75]\nIn February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Ryan accusing Republicans with having waged a \"cover-up campaign\" to protect Trump and cited last minute changes to the memo after a vote for its release as dangerous and violating House rules, saying, \"House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.\"[76] She charged House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes with partaking in \"deliberately dishonest actions\" and called for his immediate removal from his position.[77]\nIn February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest speech in the House of Representatives when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers\u2014individuals who were brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants\u2014to object to a budget deal which would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, which were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.[78][79][80]\nIn May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign,[81] Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[82]\nIn August 2018, Pelosi called for the resignation of Duncan D. Hunter after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying in a statement that the charges were \"evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today\".[83]\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats regained a majority of seats in the House. On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker of the House.[84] She was formally re-elected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi \"clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job\". Two hundred twenty House Democrats voted to elect Pelosi speaker, while 15 other House Democrats cast their ballots for someone else or voted present.[85]\nAt the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed President Trump's attempts to use the 2018\u201319 federal government shutdown (which she called a \"hostage-taking\" of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the American border.[86] Pelosi declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House of Representatives chamber while the shutdown was ongoing.[87][88] After several news polls showed Trump's popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, he signed a January 25 resolution reopening the federal government without any concessions regarding a border wall or other issues.[89] Analysts and commentators widely called the event \"the most humiliating loss of his presidency\".[90][91]\nHaving successfully impeached President Trump on December 18, 2019, and on the eve of his trial before the U.S. Senate, the Washington Post political writer, Paul Kane, called her the most powerful House speaker in, at least, twenty-five years and noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas.[92]\nPelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader.[93]\nThe American Civil Liberties Union's Congressional Scorecard has given Pelosi a lifetime rating of 92% for her voting record on civil liberties.[94] In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[95] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[96]\nPelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[97]\nIn June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.[98] In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a deal with the devil and noted she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.[99]\nPelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[100] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage.[101][102][103] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the \"historic decision\". She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[104]\nThe LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign gave Pelosi a 100% rating in 2006 for her voting record in the 107th through 109th congresses (2001\u20132006), indicating that she voted favorably on legislation supported by the organization on every occasion.[105] In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said \"My religion compels me\u2014and I love it for it\u2014to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it's unconstitutional on top of that.\"[106]\nPelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposes Trump's transgender military ban.[107]\nPelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML's deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress hadn't done anything to change the laws.[108] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[109]\nPelosi supports the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.[110]\nAs speaker of the House, Pelosi quietly moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt.[111] In Lee's place, she had a statue of Rosa Parks erected.[111] In August 2017, Pelosi said she supported the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials from the Capitol Building.[112]\nIn 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah.[113][114][115] After the briefing, Pelosi said she \"was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal\".[116] Two unnamed former Bush Administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she didn't raise substantial objections.[117] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, \"In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.'\"[118]\nThese techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi's office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[119] Subsequently, several top Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging that CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a \"number of years\" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[120] Neither letter, lawmakers or the CIA provided details and the circumstances surrounding the allegations make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[121]\nOfficials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs.[122] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said, \"In that or any other briefing\u00a0... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel\u2014the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\"[113][123]\nPelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by the House by a 300\u2013132 vote, but in the Senate fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required (with 65 out of 100 Senators voting in favor).[124]\nAs speaker of the House, she also spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The Act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but as part of HR 2206 it was included. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by the exclusion of the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[125] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, prior to Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[126]\nPelosi opposed the welfare reform proposed by President Bush as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[127] She also opposed the tax reform signed by President Trump in December 2017, describing it as \"probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America\u00a0... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich\u00a0... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.\"[128] She said \"this is Armageddon\" and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending.[129] In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill was passed, Pelosi was asked by a reporter to respond to statements by companies attributing the tax cuts for allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits that workers got equated to \"crumbs\".[130][131] Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses of significantly over a thousand.[132]\nIn November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with President Trump on infrastructure development. Though he \"really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office\" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would \"create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions\".[133] On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer met with President Trump about infrastructure funding.[134] In late May a meeting to discuss an impending $2 trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when President Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.[135]\nIn August 2018, after President Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi lauded the move as \"an important first step\" but requested the president adhere to a wish by California Governor Jerry Brown for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called for the Trump administration to take \"real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive\".[136]\nIn 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools.[137] Pelosi voted for the No Child Left Behind Act,[138] which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[139][140]\nIn 2019, Pelosi said climate change was \"the existential threat of our time\", and called for action to curb climate change.[141]\nPelosi has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence upon foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[142] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[143][144]\nPelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[145]\nSpeaker Pelosi was instrumental in the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Pelosi was a key figure in convincing President Barack Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in a January special election, a defeat that was seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[58] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's signature health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[146]\nPelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[147] She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders' bill for single payer healthcare.[148][149]\nOn March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act but would also be willing to form a compromise measure in the event that Republicans were unable to pass a compromise bill and reached out for bipartisan support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.[150] In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called for lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to put pressure on Republicans in the health-care discussion. Pelosi said the Democrats would be unified as putting \"a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill\".[151]\nIn July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said the goal of the Democrats \"has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits\u00a0... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.\"[152] In November 2018, after the Democrats gained a majority in the House following the 2018 midterm elections, Pelosi said, \"I'm staying as speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families and if Hillary had won, I could go home.\" She further stated that Republicans had misrepresented their prior position of being opposed to pre-existing conditions during the election cycle and called for Republicans to join Democrats in \"removing all doubt that the pre-existing medical condition is the law\u2014the benefit\u2014is the law of the land\".[153]\nPelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[154]\nShe has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas (HA 209, rejected), in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision that forbids service women and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected), in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[154]\nIn 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C. for being \"incorrect\" in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to come with a definition of when life begins. During the interview she said, \"over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.\"[155] In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy.\nIn a January 25, 2009 interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said, \"Well, the family planning services reduce cost. They reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now and part of what we do for children's health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs. One of those\u2014one of the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception, will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government.\"[156]\nPelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the \"Boldest possible move\" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabrielle Giffords.[157] In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association for her stances on gun control.[158]\nIn February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans cowering to the gun lobby was \"an assault on our whole country\" and that the victims were \"paying the price for our inaction\". She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and noted Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.[159]\nIn November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans \"deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets\" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.[160]\nWith regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support such legislation.[161]\nIn March 2009, the New York Post wrote that the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting that the United States Air Force (USAF) provide specific aircraft\u2014a Boeing 757\u2014for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[162][163][164] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested\u2014for security reasons\u2014that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said \"no one has rendered judgment\" that Pelosi's use of aircraft \"is excessive\".[165]\nDuring a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by Trump responding to the testimony of former FBI James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness.[166] In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[167]\nIn January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance that was without serious policy ideas both parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump's refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them.[168] In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was \"a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people\" and \"part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president\" who had shown he had something to hide.[169] In March, Pelosi said she was \"more concerned about the president's policies which undermine the financial security of America's working families\" than the Stormy Daniels\u2013Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat.[170] In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon \"sends a troubling signal to the president's allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon \"poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy\".[171] On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was \"a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics\", and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration.[172] Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019.[173] In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the Leader of the Opposition Juan Guaid\u00f3 during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.[174]\nThe Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members, and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration.[175] In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy all subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.[176] On May 7, 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the Committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged \"Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment\",[177][178] described Trump's interference regarding McGahn's records as an obstruction of justice, stating that \"Trump is goading us to impeach him.\"[179][180]\nOn May 22, 2019, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared, \"we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\"[181] Later that day, after learning of Pelosi's comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him.[182] Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of \"obstructing justice\" and again said he \"is engaged in a cover-up\".[182]\nOn June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wants to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted.[183]\nIn March 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet and called on \"freedom-loving people\" worldwide to denounce China. She said, \"The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world\", while addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India.[184]\nIn October 2008, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its \"bold decision\" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia. Pelosi's statement read, \"I call on the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.\"[185]\nPelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should \"shock the conscience of the world\".[186]\nBefore the Trump Administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfill his own campaign commitments to label China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.[187][188][189][190]\nIn September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Chinese media criticized Pelosi sharply for this meeting, accusing her of \"backing and encouraging radical activists\".[191]\nPelosi publicly scolded Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had \"expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations\" of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[192] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.[193]\nIn 2008, Pelosi said: \"For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges\u2014people to people exchanges with Cuba.\"[194] In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro's regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.[195]\nPelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[127][196]\nIn a February 15, 2007, interview Pelosi noted that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran \"and I take him at his word\". At the same time, she said, \"I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran\".[197] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[198] requiring that\u2014absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces\u2014the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[199] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007.\nIn July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a \"very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran\" and called the deal \"a diplomatic masterpiece\".[200]\nIn 2016, Pelosi argued against the passage of two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: \"Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.\"[201]\nIn May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and \"particularly senseless, disturbing &amp; dangerous\".[202]\nIn 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force against Iraq,[203] while stating that Iraq, like \"other countries of concern\", had WMDs.[204] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi noted that Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein's launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low. \"This is about the Constitution,\" Pelosi said. \"It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.\" While Pelosi opposed, Congress still passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States against Iraq.[205]\nAlthough Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.[206] Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.[207]\nPelosi reaffirms that \"America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship\".[208] Pelosi emphasized that \"a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,\u00a0... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe.\" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.[209] Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli \"hopeful signs\" of offering land, while criticizing Palestinian \"threats\" of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, \"If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace\".[208]\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921 on the count that \"the seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond\". She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah \"have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent\". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border \"have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah\" in part for their use of \"civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas\".[210]\nIn September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the \"strong friendship\" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a \"symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel\".[211]\nPelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[212] In March 2018 Pelosi said, \"There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.\"[213] In March 2019, she said, \"Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.\"[214]\nIn January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution condemning the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.[215][216]\nNancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.[217][218]\nIn August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea \"will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were \"recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.\"[219]\nIn November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea's nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to \"exhaust every other remedy\".[220]\nIn June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, \"In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime's status quo.\"[221]\nIn December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved \"a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack\" and \"America's democracy and national security\" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to \"fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks\".[222]\nIn February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.[223] In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.[224] She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: \"Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital.\" She called for House Speaker Ryan to \"make clear that there is not\u2014and never will be\u2014an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.\"[225]\nPelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that \"for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough\" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. \"If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.\"[226]\nPelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.[227] She also favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[228]\nIn January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump's announcement a \"Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin\".[229] In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump's deserting the US's \"Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman\" Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey and opined that the decision \"poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.\"[230]\nIn mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[231] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.\u2013Turkey relations.[232] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[233]\nThe resolution was passed during Pelosi's second term as a speaker. The house voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.[234]\nPelosi's only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent,[19][235] then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1.[236] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 Census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only twice.\nShe met Paul Frank Pelosi while she was attending college.[237] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[238] After the couple married, they moved to New York, and then to San Francisco in 1969, where Paul Pelosi's brother, Ronald Pelosi, was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[239]\nNancy and Paul Pelosi have five children: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, as well as nine grandchildren.[240] Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[241]\nPelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.[242][243] Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhome in Loomis, California.[244]\nThe nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) estimated in 2009 that Pelosi's average net worth was US$58,436,537, ranking her 13th among 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[245] In 2014, CRP reported Pelosi's average net worth in 2014 was US$101,273,023 having ranked 8th out of 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[246] Business Insider reported that Pelosi's worth was $26.4 million in 2012 and made her the 13th richest member of Congress.[247] In 2014, Roll Call estimated that Pelosi's net worth was $29.35 million, ranking her the 15th wealthiest member of Congress.[248]\nRoll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast, and Facebook. Roll Call reported that the Pelosis have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to Roll Call, Pelosi and her husband hold properties \"worth at least $14.65 million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5 million, and commercial real estate in San Francisco.\"[248]\nPelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[249] She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nBritney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Born in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\", Spears is regarded as a pop icon and is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in Crossroads (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.[1] Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations led Spears to be placed on a still ongoing conservatorship. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), respectively. In 2012, Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58\u00a0million, having last topped the list in 2002.[2] During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her conservator, leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team. Spears has scored six number one albums on the Billboard 200, making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.[3] Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Womanizer\", \"3\", \"Hold It Against Me\", and \"S&M\". Other singles, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" and \"Toxic\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award;[4] the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[5] Billboard ranked her as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s decade.[6] One of the world's best-selling music artists, Spears has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] including over 70 million records in the United States.[8][9] In the United States, Spears is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era[10] as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.[11][12][13] In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded US$1.5\u00a0billion as of 2012[update].[14] Spears has topped the list of most searched celebrities seven times in 12 years, a record since the inception of the internet.[15] Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981 in McComb, Mississippi,[16][17] the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[18] Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn Spears.[19] She was born in the Bible Belt, where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a particularly strong religious influence;[20] Spears was baptized as a Southern Baptist and sang in a church choir as a child.[21] As an adult, she has studied Kabbalist teachings.[22] At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her kindergarten graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[23][24][25] She said about her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\".[24] At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[26][27] In December 1992, she was cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\"[24][28] In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\"[29] Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[29] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation\u2014the 'eye of the tiger'\u2014is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"[24] Spears sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.[30] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\"[31] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger; more adult contemporary.\" She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it\u2014it's more me.\"[24] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[24] After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.[32] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[33] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[34] It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.[25] The title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.[31] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[35][36] \"...Baby One More Time\" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[37] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[38] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[39] Spears is the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the UK.[40] \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ...Baby One More Time album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide,[41][42] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is the best-selling debut album by any artist.[43][44][45] On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics.[46] It also generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[47] An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[28] Oops!... I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the Nielsen SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[48] The album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date,[49] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that \"the great thing about Oops!\u00a0\u2013 under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition.\"[50] The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.[40][51] The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[52] The same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.[25][53] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[54] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.[25] Spears and Timberlake would both graduate high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School.[55][56] She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.[57] In February 2001, Spears signed a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled A Mother's Gift.[25] Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[58] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.[40][59][60] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[61] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations\u2014Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"\u2014 and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".[62][63] The album's first single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[64] Spears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[54] Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"[65] To support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[66][67] The tour grossed $43.7\u00a0million, becoming the second highest-grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[68] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[69] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success.[70][71][72] Crossroads, which had a $12\u00a0million budget, went on to gross over $61.1\u00a0million worldwide.[72] In June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".[73] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[74] Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[75][76] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[77] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that \"I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.\"[78] In August 2003, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.[72] In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[79] while Blender magazine cited it as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[80] Spears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[25] Vibe called it \"A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter.\"[81] NPR listed the album as one of \"The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade\", adding that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.\"[82] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States during its first week of availability in the United States, debuting at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[25] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.[83] In the Zone sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[84] The album produced four singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"\u2014which won Spears her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\", and \"Outrageous\".[25] In January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".[85] In March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[86] In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[87] During 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[88] In July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[25] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[89] Shortly after, she released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[90] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[91] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative\" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway.[92] The second single, \"Do Somethin'\", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe.[93][94] In August 2005, Spears released \"Someday (I Will Understand)\", which was dedicated to her first child, a son, who was born the following month.[95] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.[96] It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[97] In February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[25] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode \"Buy, Buy Baby\" as closeted lesbian Amber Louise.[98] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, \"my baby is my religion.\"[88] Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[25] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son.[99] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[100] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.[101] Spears's aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[102] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks.[103] In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M's Tour.[104] In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her children to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[105] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video \"Do Somethin'\" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[106] In October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted at the top of charts in Canada and Ireland, number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Korea, New Zealand and many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart.[107] The album received positive reviews from critics and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[108][109] Blackout won Album of the Year at MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times.[110][111] Spears performed the lead single \"Gimme More\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was panned by many critics.[112] Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted.[113][114] The second single \"Piece of Me\" reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single \"Break the Ice\" was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly.[115][116][117] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[118] In January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that had arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an unidentified substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary, and later, permanent[119] conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[25] She was released five days later.[120] The following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Ten Sessions\" as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever.[121][122] In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel.[123] In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for \"Piece of Me\".[124] A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears's return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008.[125] The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6\u00a0million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network's history.[126] In December 2008, Spears's sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[127] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations.[114][128] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[129] She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[128] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[130] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[131] Its lead single, \"Womanizer\", became Spears's first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since \"...Baby One More Time\". The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden.[132][133] It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.[134] In January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley \u2013 all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears's affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members.[135] Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8\u00a0million, it became the fifth highest-grossing tour of the year.[136] In November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection.

The episode drew Glee's highest ratings ever.[140][141] In March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale.[142] The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women.[3] It has sold 1 million copies in the United States, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[143] The album's lead single, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears's fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number one, after Mariah Carey.[144] The second single \"Till the World Ends\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May,[145] while the third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears's first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single \"Criminal\" was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.[146] Spears's management briefly responded, stating, \"The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.\"[147] In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna's song \"S&M\".[148] It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart.[149] On Billboard's 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year,[150] thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.[151][152] Spears co-wrote \"Whiplash\", a song from American pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene' third album When the Sun Goes Down.[153] In June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour.[154] The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2\u00a0million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.[155] The tour ended on December 10, 2011 in Puerto Rico after 79 performances.[156] A DVD of the tour was released in November 2011.[157] In August 2011, Spears received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[158] The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2.[159] In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent.[160] Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012.[161] In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears's co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.[162][163] In May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15\u00a0million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history.[164] However, Katy Perry broke her record in 2018 after Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of American Idol.[165][166] She mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show's third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland.[167] Spears was featured on will.i.am's \"Scream & Shout\", which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013).

Her team also announced that Spears would go on an indefinite work hiatus, putting all activities and commitments on hold, so that she can spend time with her family.[240] In March 2019, Spears's co-conservator Andrew Wallet resigned, and said \"Substantial detriment, irreparable harm and immediate danger will result to the conservatee and her estate if the relief requested herein in not granted on an ex parte basis.\"[241] The same month, Spears reportedly entered a psychiatric facility to focus on self-care amidst stress from her father's illness.[242] The podcast Britney's Gram alleged, according to information from an anonymous paralegal source, that Spears had been held against her will in the facility since January 2019. They claimed the hospitalization and Domination cancellation were ordered by Spears's father after she decided to not take her medication and violated rules in her conservatorship, specifically driving. Britney's Gram and several news outlets questioned the length of the conservatorship, as it was supposed to end after The Circus Tour in 2009.[243] Following the podcast, there was social media backlash to the alleged abuse of power and violation of human rights Spears has endured under a conservatorship by her father and the mismanagement of Lou Taylor, who was responsible for initiating the conservatorship.[244] TMZ later posted several conflicting stories, detailing in a video that although Spears had not been formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she is receiving medication for it, and justified this, which was later deleted.[245] On April 22, 2019, fans held a protest outside the West Hollywood City Hall, drawing attention towards the prolonged conservatorship, suggesting she was being detained against her will.[246][247][248] Spears posted a video Instagram account on April 24, assuring fans all is well and also addressed leaked emails about Lou Taylor, claiming they were written by her ex-manager Sam Lutfi.\"[249][250] Spears left the facility the following day.[251] It was reported on April 24, 2019, that Spears would have a new conservatorship hearing for May 10, 2019.[252] Spears attended the hearing with her mother.[253][254] Following the hearing, an investigation was ordered into Spears's conservatorship.[255] According to alleged reports by TMZ, she stated in court that she was forcibly put into the mental health facility.[256][257] On September 3, 2019, it was reported that Spears' father and conservator allegedly abused her thirteen year old son, Sean Preston. Law enforcement spoke to The Blast to report the incident, stating Kevin Federline filed a police report on August 25.[258] It was later reported that Jamie Spears was reportedly so enraged during an argument with his 13-year-old grandson that he broke down a door to get to the young boy, and the incident has sparked a child abuse investigation. Britney then sent her sons back to their father's home, despite it still being her custodial visit time.[259] Spears' two sons have since been granted a three year restraining order against their grandfather.[260] Spears has cited Madonna, Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston as being major influences in her career, her \"three favorite artists\" as a child, whom she would \"sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room\"; Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.[261] Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence. According to Spears: \"I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.\"[262] In the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: \"I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.\"[263] After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: \"she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\"[264] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist [...] There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".[265] She has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Timberlake, Natalie Imbruglia, Cher, and Prince as sources of inspiration.[266][267][268][269][270] Spears also felt inspired by artists from younger generations, such as Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande.[271][272] Spears is described as a pop singer[17] and generally explores the genre in the form of dance-pop.[273][274][275] Following her debut, she was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s.[276] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.\"[277] In a review for ...Baby One More Time, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to her music as a \"blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry.\"[278] Oops!...I Did It Again saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, which led to \"a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga.\"[279] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche \"[r]hythmically and melodically\", but was described as \"sharper, tougher than what came before\", incorporating genres such as R&B, disco and funk.[61][280] Spears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop[281][282] and dance music in her records, as well as influences of urban and hip hop which are most present in In the Zone and Blackout.[282][283][284] Femme Fatale and Britney Jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres.[285][286] The music found on ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again generally explores themes such as love and relationships from a teenager's point of view.[287][288] After the enormous success of her first two studio albums, Spears's team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts.[287] Spears, however, was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records. She cowrote five songs and choose each track's producer on Britney, her third studio album, which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood, sexuality and self-discovery.[61][287][280] Sex, dancing, freedom and love continued to be Spears's music main subjects on her subsequent albums.[283][284][286][285] Her fifth studio album, Blackout, also address issues such as media scrutiny and fame, most notably in \"Piece of Me\".[284][289] Spears is a soprano.[294][295][296][297] Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung \"much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today\", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears for her debut album ...Baby One More Time, being cited as \"[shaping] her voice over the course of a month\" upon being signed to Jive Records \"to where it is today\u2014distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[29] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, \"I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.\"[298] Guy Blackman of The Age wrote that \"[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. [...] Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.\"[299] Producer William Orbit, who collaborated with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: \"[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing\".[300] Spears has also been criticized for her reliance on auto-tune[301] and her vocals being \"over-processed\" on records.[302] Erlewine criticized Spears's poor singing abilities in a review for Blackout, saying, \"Never the greatest vocalist, her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes, but nearly a decade later her singing hasn't gotten any better, even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have.\"[284] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that \"Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.\"[303] The Michigan Daily's Kayla Upadhyaya provided a different point of view, saying, \"Auto-tuned and over-processed vocals define Britney's voice as an artist, and in her music, auto-tune isn't so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight, contort and make a statement.\"[304] Spears is known for her stage performances, particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate \"belly-dancing and tempered erotic moves\" that are credited for influencing \"dance-heavy acts\" such as Danity Kane and the Pussycat Dolls.[305][306] Rolling Stone magazine readers voted Spears as the second Favorite Dancing Musician.[307] Spears is described as being much more shy than what her stage persona suggests.[308][309][310] She claimed that performing is \"a boost to [her] confidence. It's like an alter-ego type thing. Something clicks and I go and turn into this different person. I think it's kind of a gift to be able to do that.\"[311] Her 2000, 2001, and 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performances received praise,[312] while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics, as she \"teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words\".[313] Billboard called her 2016 \"comeback\" performance at the show \"An effective, but not entirely glorious, bid to regain pop superstardom\".[296] After her knee injuries and personal struggles, Spears's \"showmanship\" and dance abilities came under criticism.[305][314] Serge F. Kovaleski of The New York Times watched her Las Vegas concert residency in 2016 and said: \"Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets.\"[315] Las Vegas Sun's Robin Leach seemed more impressed over Spears's efforts on the concert by saying that she delivered a \"flawless performance\" on the residency's opening night.[316] It has been widely reported that Spears lip-syncs during live performances,[306][317][318] which often draws criticism from music critics and concert goers.[314][319][320] Some, however, claimed that, although she \"got plenty of digital support\", she \"doesn't merely lip-sync\" during her live shows.[321] In 2016, Sabrina Weiss of Refinery29 referred to her lip-syncing as a \"well-known fact that's not even taboo anymore.\"[322] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, Los Angeles Daily News opined: \"In the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? [...] you [just] go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all\".[323] Spears spoke on the topic saying \"[...] Because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback.\" She added: \"It really pisses me off because I'm busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it, you know?\"[317] Spears rose to fame as a bubblegum pop singer in the late 1990s and was labelled as a teen idol.[324][325] Rolling Stone magazine described Spears in her early years of fame as \"the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.\"[326] The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing an open top revealing her bra, and shorts.[326] The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears responded to the outcry commenting, \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\"[327] Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage.[25][328] Billboard opined that, by the time she released her second album Oops!... I Did it Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001\u2019s Britney\".[329] Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its video were also credited for distancing her from her \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image of the past.[324][330] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[283] Spears's erratic behavior and personal struggles during 2006\u20142008 were highly publicised[331] and affected both her career and public image.[284][332] Erlewine reflected on that time of her career by saying that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\".[284] Spears later received favorable media attention. Time's Cady Lang observed that she looked healthier during her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards,[312] while Business Insider wrote an article about how Spears \"lost control of her life [...] and then made an incredible career comeback\".[333] In September 2002, she was ranked eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list,[334] and, in December 2012, Complex ranked her 12 on its 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time list.[335] Spears commented on her sex symbol image by saying, \"[...] When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that \u2014 and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And people tend to believe it.\"[287] In 2003, People cited her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[336] Spears is also recognized as a gay icon. She was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[233] Billboard's Patrick Crowley reflected on her winning the award, \"While it's no secret that LGBTQ fans saw their struggle reflected in Spears' particularly rough mid-career slump, followed by her phoenix-like rise back to the top of the charts\u2014it's really her outstanding advocacy for the community that earned her this award.\"[337] Manuel Betancourt of Vice magazine wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears's fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga [...] she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\"[308] Since her early years of stardom, Spears become a tabloid fixture and a paparazzi target, which affected her personal life as well.[329][338][328] Steve Huey of AllMusic claimed that \"among female singers of [Spears's] era [...] her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\"[328] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[339] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[340] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000\u20132009.[341] E!'s Melanie Bromley described her 2007 highly publicised breakdown as \"one of the biggest public meltdowns in pop culture history.\"[338] She reflected on that time of her life in a 2017 interview, saying \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. [...] I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that\u2019s who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"[342] As a public figure, Spears \"has never been very publicly political\".[343] In October 2001, she registered as a Republican in Louisiana, according to public records.[343] In a September 2003 interview on CNN, she spoke about the then-U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, by saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes [...] and be faithful in what happens\".[343][344] In 2016, she posted photos of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on her social media.[343] Spears was described by Rolling Stone magazine as \"One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 2000s\", which also pointed out that she, alongside other acts, \"spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop.\"[276] Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote in 2000: \"Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena\u00a0\u2014 a child with a full-time career. [...] Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry.\"[345] Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears's \"sexy and coy\" vocals on her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come.\"[346] Spears has been recognised with a number of honorific nicknames, most notably the \"Princess of Pop.\"[347][348] Billboard claimed that she \"has earned her title as one of pop's reigning queens. Since her early days as a Mouseketeer, [Spears] has pushed the boundaries of 21st century sounds, paving the way for a generation of artists to shamelessly embrace glossy pop and redefine how one can accrue consistent success in the music industry.\"[329] In 2012, she was ranked as the fourth VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era show list.[349] VH1 also cited her among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music in 2012[350] and the 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons in 2003.[351] NME critics ranked her single \"Toxic\" at number 92 on the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, writing that the song \"reinvented popular dance music.\"[352] In 2011, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly commented on Spears's voice and music: \"We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer [...] we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. [...] She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. [...] Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.\"[353] In 2018, Rolling Stone included Spears on its Millennial 100 list and said that, following the release of her music career in the late 1990s, she \"quickly became the princess of pop, helping to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed New Kids on the Block. [...] Spears would lead an army of pop stars... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time \u2014 and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.\"[354] Spears's work has influenced artists including Taylor Swift,[355] Katy Perry,[356] Meghan Trainor,[357] Demi Lovato,[356] Kelly Key,[358] Kristinia DeBarge,[359] Little Boots,[360] Charli XCX,[361] Marina Diamandis,[362] Tegan and Sara,[363] Pixie Lott,[364] Grimes,[365] Selena Gomez,[366] Hailee Steinfeld,[367] Tinashe,[368] Victoria Justice,[369] Cassie,[370] Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust,[371] The Saturdays,[372] Normani,[373] Miley Cyrus,[374] Cheryl,[375] Lana Del Rey,[376] Ava Max,[377] and Billie Eilish.[378] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[379] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her \"the most provocative performer of my time.\"[380] Before Spears joined The X Factor, Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about \u2013 not just pop stars \u2013 but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[381] Marina Diamandis named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart.[382] Lana Del Rey has said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[383] Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child. Black describes her music as a \"love child between\" Marilyn Manson and Spears.[384] Spears's much-publicized personal struggles and her career comeback after this period has inspired some artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired by the singer's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[385] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears's comeback after her much-publicized personal issues as an inspiration.[386] Spears's hounding by paparazzi and personal struggles also contributed to inspiring Barry Manilow's album 15 Minutes. Manilow said: \"She couldn't have a life without them pulling up next to her car and following her and driving her crazy to the point where, that was around the time she shaved off her hair. [...] We all looked at it in horror [...] So it seemed like a thing to be writing an album about.\"[387] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called \"Britney\", which was inspired by \"culture's make-or-break treatment of celebrities.\"[388] Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the \"Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist\" for her debut album ...Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[389] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: \"She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide\".[390] As of 2017[update], according to Billboard, she has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time; and more than 70 million records in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.[8][9] Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s in the United States, as well as the fifth overall.[11] In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[6] She is one of the few artists in history to have had a number one single and a number one studio album in the US during each of the three decades of her career.[391] With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.[144] In 2016, Spears ranked at number twenty on Billboard's Greatest Of All Time Top Dance Club Artists list.[392] In 2000, the singer released a limited edition of sunglasses titled Shades of Britney.[393] In 2001, Spears signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[394] and a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[395] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of \"Gladiators\" with singers Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[396] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[397] In March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[398] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, explained why they choose the singer, saying, \"everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success.\"[398] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[139] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever and PlentyofFish to release her music video for \"Hold It Against Me\", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[399] Spears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of \"Till the World Ends\". The singer was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game. Spears was also featured on the commercial of \"Twister Rave\" and the game included a Twister remix of \"Circus\".[400] In March 2018, it was revealed that Spears would be the face of KENZO, a contemporary French luxury clothing house.[231] Spears's range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] By 2009, she had released seven more perfumes including Fantasy.[401][402] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance. In March 2011, company Brand Sense filed a lawsuit against Spears and Elizabeth Arden seeking $10\u00a0million in damages, claiming that the singer and her father, Jamie, stopped paying their thirty-five percent commission that was agreed as part of the contract terms.[403] In July 2011, a Los Angeles judge denied the request by the company lawyers, claiming the fact that Spears is still under conservatorship.[404] Brand Sense, however, stated that they would appeal the decision.[404] In 2011, Radiance was re-issued as a new perfume titled Cosmic Radiance.[405] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5\u00a0billion. In 2016, Spears contacted Glu Mobile to create her own role-playing game, Britney Spears: American Dream. The app officially launched in May 2016 and is compatible with IOS and Android.[204] On June 17, 2016, Spears announced the release of her twentieth fragrance, Private Show.[406] As of January\u00a02018[update], Spears has released 24 fragrances through Elizabeth Arden.[407] The singer founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[408] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[409] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1\u00a0million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[410] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[411] After the singer went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[412] On October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name \"Artists Against AIDS Worldwide\", released a single titled \"What's Going On\", with the intention to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[413] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[414] Later in 2011, the singer raised $200,000 during An Evening of Southern Style at a private residence in Beverly Hills to benefit the St. Bernard Project, with the help of several celebrities, including Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Kellan Lutz and Kim Kardashian.[415] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[416] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[417] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[414] On October 24, 2015, Spears donated $120,000 to the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.[418] In addition, $1 of each ticket sale for her Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, was donated to the nonprofit organization.[419] Spears also fundraised for the charity through social media, in addition to selling limited edition merchandise, with all proceeds going to the NCCF.[420] On October 27, 2016, Spears partnered with Zappos and XCYCLE to host the Britney Spears Piece of Me Charity Ride in Boca Park, Las Vegas to raise additional money toward her goal of $1\u00a0million for the NCCF, with $450,000 having already been raised from Spears's ticket sales and merchandise.[421] Participants were entered for a chance to win a spin class with Spears herself. The event ultimately went on to raise $553,130.[422] The fundraising ultimately led to the development of the NCCF Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas, which saw its grand opening on November 4, 2017.[423] Spears also regularly participates in Spirit Day to combat bullying of LGBTQ youth and bullying.[424]",

Born in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\", Spears is regarded as a pop icon and is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in Crossroads (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.[1] Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations led Spears to be placed on a still ongoing conservatorship. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), respectively. In 2012, Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58\u00a0million, having last topped the list in 2002.[2] During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her conservator, leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the Billboard 200, making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.[3] Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Womanizer\", \"3\", \"Hold It Against Me\", and \"S&amp;M\". Other singles, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" and \"Toxic\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award;[4] the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[5]\nBillboard ranked her as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s decade.[6] One of the world's best-selling music artists, Spears has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] including over 70 million records in the United States.[8][9] In the United States, Spears is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era[10] as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.[11][12][13] In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded US$1.5\u00a0billion as of 2012[update].[14] Spears has topped the list of most searched celebrities seven times in 12 years, a record since the inception of the internet.[15]\nBritney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981 in McComb, Mississippi,[16][17] the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[18] Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn Spears.[19] She was born in the Bible Belt, where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a particularly strong religious influence;[20] Spears was baptized as a Southern Baptist and sang in a church choir as a child.[21] As an adult, she has studied Kabbalist teachings.[22]\nAt age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her kindergarten graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[23][24][25] She said about her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\".[24]\nAt age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[26][27] In December 1992, she was cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\"[24][28]\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\"[29]\nTwo weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[29] Senior vice president of A&amp;R Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation\u2014the 'eye of the tiger'\u2014is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"[24] Spears sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.[30] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\"[31] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger; more adult contemporary.\" She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it\u2014it's more me.\"[24] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[24]\nAfter Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.[32] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[33] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[34] It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.[25]\nThe title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.[31] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[35][36] \"...Baby One More Time\" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[37] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[38] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[39] Spears is the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the UK.[40] \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ...Baby One More Time album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide,[41][42] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is the best-selling debut album by any artist.[43][44][45]\nOn June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics.[46] It also generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[47] An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[28]\nOops!... I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the Nielsen SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[48] The album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date,[49] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that \"the great thing about Oops!\u00a0\u2013 under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock &amp; roll tradition.\"[50] The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.[40][51] The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[52]\nThe same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.[25][53] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[54] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.[25] Spears and Timberlake would both graduate high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School.[55][56] She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.[57]\nIn February 2001, Spears signed a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled A Mother's Gift.[25] Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[58] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.[40][59][60] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[61] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations\u2014Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"\u2014 and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".[62][63] The album's first single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[64] Spears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[54] Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"[65]\nTo support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[66][67] The tour grossed $43.7\u00a0million, becoming the second highest-grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[68] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[69] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success.[70][71][72] Crossroads, which had a $12\u00a0million budget, went on to gross over $61.1\u00a0million worldwide.[72]\nIn June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".[73] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[74] Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[75][76] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[77] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that \"I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.\"[78]\nIn August 2003, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.[72] In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[79] while Blender magazine cited it as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[80] Spears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[25] Vibe called it \"A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter.\"[81] NPR listed the album as one of \"The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade\", adding that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.\"[82] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States during its first week of availability in the United States, debuting at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[25] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.[83] In the Zone sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[84] The album produced four singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"\u2014which won Spears her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\", and \"Outrageous\".[25]\nIn January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".[85]\nIn March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[86] In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[87]\nDuring 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[88]\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[25] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[89] Shortly after, she released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[90] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[91] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative\" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway.[92] The second single, \"Do Somethin'\", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe.[93][94] In August 2005, Spears released \"Someday (I Will Understand)\", which was dedicated to her first child, a son, who was born the following month.[95] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.[96] It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[97]\nIn February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[25] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will &amp; Grace episode \"Buy, Buy Baby\" as closeted lesbian Amber Louise.[98] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, \"my baby is my religion.\"[88] Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[25] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son.[99] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[100] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.[101]\nSpears's aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[102] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day.

The performance was panned by many critics.[112] Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted.[113][114] The second single \"Piece of Me\" reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single \"Break the Ice\" was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly.[115][116][117] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[118]\nIn January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that had arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an unidentified substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary, and later, permanent[119] conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[25] She was released five days later.[120]\nThe following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Ten Sessions\" as receptionist Abby.

She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for \"Piece of Me\".[124] A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears's return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008.[125] The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6\u00a0million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network's history.[126]\nIn December 2008, Spears's sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[127] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations.[114][128] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[129] She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[128] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[130] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[131] Its lead single, \"Womanizer\", became Spears's first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since \"...Baby One More Time\".

The episode drew Glee's highest ratings ever.[140][141]\nIn March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale.[142] The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women.[3] It has sold 1 million copies in the United States, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[143]\nThe album's lead single, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears's fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number one, after Mariah Carey.[144] The second single \"Till the World Ends\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May,[145] while the third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears's first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single \"Criminal\" was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.[146] Spears's management briefly responded, stating, \"The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.\"[147] In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna's song \"S&amp;M\".[148] It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart.[149] On Billboard's 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year,[150] thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.[151][152] Spears co-wrote \"Whiplash\", a song from American pop rock band Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene' third album When the Sun Goes Down.[153]\nIn June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour.[154] The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2\u00a0million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.[155] The tour ended on December 10, 2011 in Puerto Rico after 79 performances.[156] A DVD of the tour was released in November 2011.[157] In August 2011, Spears received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[158] The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2.[159] In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent.[160] Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012.[161] In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears's co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.[162][163]\nIn May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15\u00a0million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history.[164] However, Katy Perry broke her record in 2018 after Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of American Idol.[165][166] She mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show's third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland.[167] Spears was featured on will.i.am's \"Scream &amp; Shout\", which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013). The song later became Spears's sixth number one single on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at No. 3 on US Billboard Hot 100. Scream &amp; Shout was among the best selling songs of 2012 and 2013 with denoting sales of over 8.1\u00a0million worldwide, the accompanying music video was the third-most viewed video in 2013 on VEVO despite the video being released in 2012.[168][failed verification] In December, Forbes magazine named her music's top-earning woman of 2012, with estimated earnings of $58\u00a0million.[169]\nSpears began work on her eighth studio album, Britney Jean, in December 2012,[170] and enlisted will.i.am as its executive producer in May 2013.[171] During the production of Britney Jean, Spears recorded the song \"Ooh La La\" for the soundtrack of The Smurfs 2, which was released in June 2013.[172] On September 17, 2013, she appeared on Good Morning America to announce her two-year concert residency at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, titled Britney: Piece of Me. It began on December 27, 2013, and included a total of 100 shows throughout 2014 and 2015.[173][174] During the same appearance, Spears announced that Britney Jean would be released on December 3, 2013, in the United States.[175][176] It was released through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records in 2011, which had formed the joint RCA/Jive Label Group (initially known as BMG Label Group) between 2007 and 2011.[177] Britney Jean became Spears's final project under her original recording contract with Jive, which had guaranteed the release of eight studio albums.[178] The record received a low amount of promotion and had little commercial impact, reportedly due to time conflicts involving preparations for Britney: Piece of Me.[179] Upon its release, the record debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies, becoming her lowest-peaking and lowest-selling album in the United States.[180] Britney Jean debuted at number 34 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 12,959 copies in its first week. In doing so, it became Spears's lowest-charting and lowest-selling album in the country.[181]\n\"Work Bitch\" was released as the lead single from Britney Jean on September 16, 2013, one day earlier than expected after being leaked online.[182] It debuted and peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 marking Spears's 31st song on the chart and the fifth highest debut of her career on the chart, and her seventh in the top 20. It also marked Spears's 19th top 20 hit and overall her 23rd top 40 hit. The song marked Spears's highest sales debut since her 2011 number one hit \"Hold It Against Me\". \"Work Bitch\" also had commercial success in the UK debuting and peaking at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart.

Spears and Azalea performed the track live at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards from The AXIS, the home of Spears's residency, to positive critical response. Entertainment Weekly praised the performance, noting \"Spears gave one of her most energetic televised performances in years.\"[193] On June 16, 2015, Giorgio Moroder released his album, Deja Vu, that featured Spears on \"Tom's Diner\".[194] The song was released as the fourth single from the album on October 9.[195] In an interview, Moroder praised Spears's vocals and said that she did a \"good job\" with the song and also stated that Spears \"sounds so good that you would hardly recognize her.\"[196][197] At the 2015 Teen Choice Awards, Spears received the Candie's Style Icon Award, her ninth Teen Choice Award.[198] In November, Spears guest starred as a fictionalized version of herself on The CW series, Jane the Virgin.[199] On the show, she danced to \"Toxic\" with Gina Rodriguez's character.[200]\nIn 2016, Spears confirmed via social media that she had begun recording her ninth studio album.[201] On March 1, 2016, V magazine announced that Spears would appear on the cover of its 100th issue, dated March 8, 2016, in addition to revealing three different covers shot by photographer Mario Testino for the milestone publication.[202] Editor-in-chief of the magazine, Stephen Gan, revealed that Spears was selected for the \"V100\" issue because of her status as an icon in the industry.

In total, the tour grossed $54.3 million with 260,531 tickets sold and was the sixth highest-grossing female tour of 2018, and was the United Kingdom's second best-selling female tour of 2018.[229][230] On March 20, 2018, Spears was announced as part of a campaign for French luxury fashion house Kenzo.[231] The company said it aimed to shake up the 'jungle' world of fashion with Spears's 'La Collection Memento No. 2' campaign.[232] On April 12, 2018, Spears was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[233] On April 27, 2018, Epic Rights announced a new partnership with Spears to debut her own fashion line in 2019, which would include clothing, fitness apparel, accessories, and electronics.[234] In July 2018, Spears released her first unisex fragrance, Prerogative.[235] On October 21, 2018, Spears performed at the Formula One Grand Prix in Austin, which ultimately served as the final performance of her Piece of Me Tour.[236]\nOn October 18, 2018, Spears announced her second Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Domination, which was set to launch at Park MGM's Park Theatre on February 13, 2019.[237] Spears was slated to make $507,000 per show, which would have made her the highest paid act on the Las Vegas Strip.[238][239] However, on January 4, 2019, she announced that the residency was cancelled after her father had a near-fatal colon rupture. Her team also announced that Spears would go on an indefinite work hiatus, putting all activities and commitments on hold, so that she can spend time with her family.[240] In March 2019, Spears's co-conservator Andrew Wallet resigned, and said \"Substantial detriment, irreparable harm and immediate danger will result to the conservatee and her estate if the relief requested herein in not granted on an ex parte basis.\"[241] The same month, Spears reportedly entered a psychiatric facility to focus on self-care amidst stress from her father's illness.[242] The podcast Britney's Gram alleged, according to information from an anonymous paralegal source, that Spears had been held against her will in the facility since January 2019. They claimed the hospitalization and Domination cancellation were ordered by Spears's father after she decided to not take her medication and violated rules in her conservatorship, specifically driving. Britney's Gram and several news outlets questioned the length of the conservatorship, as it was supposed to end after The Circus Tour in 2009.[243]\nFollowing the podcast, there was social media backlash to the alleged abuse of power and violation of human rights Spears has endured under a conservatorship by her father and the mismanagement of Lou Taylor, who was responsible for initiating the conservatorship.[244] TMZ later posted several conflicting stories, detailing in a video that although Spears had not been formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she is receiving medication for it, and justified this, which was later deleted.[245] On April 22, 2019, fans held a protest outside the West Hollywood City Hall, drawing attention towards the prolonged conservatorship, suggesting she was being detained against her will.[246][247][248] Spears posted a video Instagram account  on April 24, assuring fans all is well and also addressed leaked emails about Lou Taylor, claiming they were written by her ex-manager Sam Lutfi.\"[249][250] Spears left the facility the following day.[251] It was reported on April 24, 2019, that Spears would have a new conservatorship hearing for May 10, 2019.[252] Spears attended the hearing with her mother.[253][254] Following the hearing, an investigation was ordered into Spears's conservatorship.[255] According to alleged reports by TMZ, she stated in court that she was forcibly put into the mental health facility.[256][257]\nOn September 3, 2019, it was reported that Spears' father and conservator allegedly abused her thirteen year old son, Sean Preston. Law enforcement spoke to The Blast to report the incident, stating Kevin Federline filed a police report on August 25.[258] It was later reported that Jamie Spears was reportedly so enraged during an argument with his 13-year-old grandson that he broke down a door to get to the young boy, and the incident has sparked a child abuse investigation. Britney then sent her sons back to their father's home, despite it still being her custodial visit time.[259] Spears' two sons have since been granted a three year restraining order against their grandfather.[260]\nSpears has cited Madonna, Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston as being major influences in her career, her \"three favorite artists\" as a child, whom she would \"sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room\"; Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.[261] Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence. According to Spears: \"I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.\"[262] In the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: \"I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.\"[263]\nAfter meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: \"she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\"[264] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist [...] There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".[265] She has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Timberlake, Natalie Imbruglia, Cher, and Prince as sources of inspiration.[266][267][268][269][270] Spears also felt inspired by artists from younger generations, such as Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande.[271][272]\nSpears is described as a pop singer[17] and generally explores the genre in the form of dance-pop.[273][274][275] Following her debut, she was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s.[276] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock &amp; roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.\"[277] In a review for ...Baby One More Time, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to her music as a \"blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry.\"[278] Oops!...I Did It Again saw Spears working with several contemporary R&amp;B producers, which led to \"a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga.\"[279] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche \"[r]hythmically and melodically\", but was described as \"sharper, tougher than what came before\", incorporating genres such as R&amp;B, disco and funk.[61][280]\nSpears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop[281][282] and dance music in her records, as well as influences of urban and hip hop which are most present in In the Zone and Blackout.[282][283][284] Femme Fatale and Britney Jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres.[285][286]\nThe music found on ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again generally explores themes such as love and relationships from a teenager's point of view.[287][288] After the enormous success of her first two studio albums, Spears's team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts.[287] Spears, however, was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records. She cowrote five songs and choose each track's producer on Britney, her third studio album, which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood, sexuality and self-discovery.[61][287][280] Sex, dancing, freedom and love continued to be Spears's music main subjects on her subsequent albums.[283][284][286][285] Her fifth studio album, Blackout, also address issues such as media scrutiny and fame, most notably in \"Piece of Me\".[284][289]\n Spears is a soprano.[294][295][296][297] Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung \"much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today\", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears for her debut album ...Baby One More Time, being cited as \"[shaping] her voice over the course of a month\" upon being signed to Jive Records \"to where it is today\u2014distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[29] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, \"I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.\"[298]\nGuy Blackman of The Age wrote that \"[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. [...] Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.\"[299] Producer William Orbit, who collaborated with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: \"[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing\".[300]\nSpears has also been criticized for her reliance on auto-tune[301] and her vocals being \"over-processed\" on records.[302] Erlewine criticized Spears's poor singing abilities in a review for Blackout, saying, \"Never the greatest vocalist, her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes, but nearly a decade later her singing hasn't gotten any better, even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have.\"[284] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that \"Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.\"[303] The Michigan Daily's Kayla Upadhyaya provided a different point of view, saying, \"Auto-tuned and over-processed vocals define Britney's voice as an artist, and in her music, auto-tune isn't so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight, contort and make a statement.\"[304]\nSpears is known for her stage performances, particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate \"belly-dancing and tempered erotic moves\" that are credited for influencing \"dance-heavy acts\" such as Danity Kane and the Pussycat Dolls.[305][306] Rolling Stone magazine readers voted Spears as the second Favorite Dancing Musician.[307] Spears is described as being much more shy than what her stage persona suggests.[308][309][310] She claimed that performing is \"a boost to [her] confidence. It's like an alter-ego type thing. Something clicks and I go and turn into this different person. I think it's kind of a gift to be able to do that.\"[311] Her 2000, 2001, and 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performances received praise,[312] while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics, as she \"teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words\".[313] Billboard called her 2016 \"comeback\" performance at the show \"An effective, but not entirely glorious, bid to regain pop superstardom\".[296]\nAfter her knee injuries and personal struggles, Spears's \"showmanship\" and dance abilities came under criticism.[305][314] Serge F. Kovaleski of The New York Times watched her Las Vegas concert residency in 2016 and said: \"Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets.\"[315] Las Vegas Sun's Robin Leach seemed more impressed over Spears's efforts on the concert by saying that she delivered a \"flawless performance\" on the residency's opening night.[316]\nIt has been widely reported that Spears lip-syncs during live performances,[306][317][318] which often draws criticism from music critics and concert goers.[314][319][320] Some, however, claimed that, although she \"got plenty of digital support\", she \"doesn't merely lip-sync\" during her live shows.[321] In 2016, Sabrina Weiss of Refinery29 referred to her lip-syncing as a \"well-known fact that's not even taboo anymore.\"[322] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, Los Angeles Daily News opined: \"In the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? [...] you [just] go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all\".[323] Spears spoke on the topic saying \"[...] Because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback.\" She added: \"It really pisses me off because I'm busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it, you know?\"[317]\nSpears rose to fame as a bubblegum pop singer in the late 1990s and was labelled as a teen idol.[324][325] Rolling Stone magazine described Spears in her early years of fame as \"the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.\"[326] The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing an open top revealing her bra, and shorts.[326] The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears responded to the outcry commenting, \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\"[327] Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage.[25][328]\nBillboard opined that, by the time she released her second album Oops!... I Did it Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001\u2019s Britney\".[329] Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its video were also credited for distancing her from her \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image of the past.[324][330] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[283]\nSpears's erratic behavior and personal struggles during 2006\u20142008 were highly publicised[331] and affected both her career and public image.[284][332] Erlewine reflected on that time of her career by saying that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\".[284] Spears later received favorable media attention. Time's Cady Lang observed that she looked healthier during her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards,[312] while Business Insider wrote an article about how Spears \"lost control of her life [...] and then made an incredible career comeback\".[333]\nIn September 2002, she was ranked eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list,[334] and, in December 2012, Complex ranked her 12 on its 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time list.[335] Spears commented on her sex symbol image by saying, \"[...] When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that \u2014 and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And people tend to believe it.\"[287] In 2003, People cited her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[336]\nSpears is also recognized as a gay icon. She was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[233] Billboard's Patrick Crowley reflected on her winning the award, \"While it's no secret that LGBTQ fans saw their struggle reflected in Spears' particularly rough mid-career slump, followed by her phoenix-like rise back to the top of the charts\u2014it's really her outstanding advocacy for the community that earned her this award.\"[337] Manuel Betancourt of Vice magazine wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears's fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga [...] she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\"[308]\nSince her early years of stardom, Spears become a tabloid fixture and a paparazzi target, which affected her personal life as well.[329][338][328] Steve Huey of AllMusic claimed that \"among female singers of [Spears's] era [...] her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\"[328] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[339] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[340] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000\u20132009.[341] E!'s Melanie Bromley described her 2007 highly publicised breakdown as \"one of the biggest public meltdowns in pop culture history.\"[338] She reflected on that time of her life in a 2017 interview, saying \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. [...] I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that\u2019s who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"[342]\nAs a public figure, Spears \"has never been very publicly political\".[343] In October 2001, she registered as a Republican in Louisiana, according to public records.[343] In a September 2003 interview on CNN, she spoke about the then-U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, by saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes [...] and be faithful in what happens\".[343][344] In 2016, she posted photos of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on her social media.[343]\nSpears was described by Rolling Stone magazine as \"One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 2000s\", which also pointed out that she, alongside other acts, \"spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop.\"[276] Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote in 2000: \"Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena\u00a0\u2014 a child with a full-time career. [...] Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry.\"[345] Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears's \"sexy and coy\" vocals on her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come.\"[346] Spears has been recognised with a number of honorific nicknames, most notably the \"Princess of Pop.\"[347][348]\nBillboard claimed that she \"has earned her title as one of pop's reigning queens. Since her early days as a Mouseketeer, [Spears] has pushed the boundaries of 21st century sounds, paving the way for a generation of artists to shamelessly embrace glossy pop and redefine how one can accrue consistent success in the music industry.\"[329] In 2012, she was ranked as the fourth VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era show list.[349] VH1 also cited her among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music in 2012[350] and the 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons in 2003.[351] NME critics ranked her single \"Toxic\" at number 92 on the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, writing that the song \"reinvented popular dance music.\"[352]\nIn 2011, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly commented on Spears's voice and music: \"We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer [...] we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. [...] She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. [...] Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.\"[353]\nIn 2018, Rolling Stone included Spears on its Millennial 100 list and said that, following the release of her music career in the late 1990s, she \"quickly became the princess of pop, helping to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed New Kids on the Block. [...] Spears would lead an army of pop stars... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time \u2014 and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.\"[354]\nSpears's work has influenced artists including Taylor Swift,[355] Katy Perry,[356] Meghan Trainor,[357] Demi Lovato,[356] Kelly Key,[358] Kristinia DeBarge,[359] Little Boots,[360] Charli XCX,[361] Marina Diamandis,[362] Tegan and Sara,[363] Pixie Lott,[364] Grimes,[365] Selena Gomez,[366] Hailee Steinfeld,[367] Tinashe,[368] Victoria Justice,[369] Cassie,[370] Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust,[371] The Saturdays,[372] Normani,[373] Miley Cyrus,[374] Cheryl,[375] Lana Del Rey,[376] Ava Max,[377] and Billie Eilish.[378] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[379] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her \"the most provocative performer of my time.\"[380] Before Spears joined The X Factor, Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about \u2013 not just pop stars \u2013 but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[381] Marina Diamandis named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart.[382] Lana Del Rey has said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[383] Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child. Black describes her music as a \"love child between\" Marilyn Manson and Spears.[384]\nSpears's much-publicized personal struggles and her career comeback after this period has inspired some artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired by the singer's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[385] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears's comeback after her much-publicized personal issues as an inspiration.[386] Spears's hounding by paparazzi and personal struggles also contributed to inspiring Barry Manilow's album 15 Minutes. Manilow said: \"She couldn't have a life without them pulling up next to her car and following her and driving her crazy to the point where, that was around the time she shaved off her hair. [...] We all looked at it in horror [...] So it seemed like a thing to be writing an album about.\"[387] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called \"Britney\", which was inspired by \"culture's make-or-break treatment of celebrities.\"[388]\nSpears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nShe is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the \"Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist\" for her debut album ...Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[389] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: \"She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide\".[390]\nAs of 2017[update], according to Billboard, she has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time; and more than 70 million records in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.[8][9] Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s in the United States, as well as the fifth overall.[11] In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[6] She is one of the few artists in history to have had a number one single and a number one studio album in the US during each of the three decades of her career.[391] With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.[144] In 2016, Spears ranked at number twenty on Billboard's Greatest Of All Time Top Dance Club Artists list.[392]\nIn 2000, the singer released a limited edition of sunglasses titled Shades of Britney.[393] In 2001, Spears signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[394] and a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[395] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of \"Gladiators\" with singers Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[396] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[397] In March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[398] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, explained why they choose the singer, saying, \"everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success.\"[398] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[139] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever and PlentyofFish to release her music video for \"Hold It Against Me\", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[399] Spears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of \"Till the World Ends\". The singer was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game. Spears was also featured on the commercial of \"Twister Rave\" and the game included a Twister remix of \"Circus\".[400] In March 2018, it was revealed that Spears would be the face of KENZO, a contemporary French luxury clothing house.[231]\nSpears's range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] By 2009, she had released seven more perfumes including Fantasy.[401][402] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance. In March 2011, company Brand Sense filed a lawsuit against Spears and Elizabeth Arden seeking $10\u00a0million in damages, claiming that the singer and her father, Jamie, stopped paying their thirty-five percent commission that was agreed as part of the contract terms.[403] In July 2011, a Los Angeles judge denied the request by the company lawyers, claiming the fact that Spears is still under conservatorship.[404] Brand Sense, however, stated that they would appeal the decision.[404] In 2011, Radiance was re-issued as a new perfume titled Cosmic Radiance.[405] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5\u00a0billion. In 2016, Spears contacted Glu Mobile to create her own role-playing game, Britney Spears: American Dream. The app officially launched in May 2016 and is compatible with IOS and Android.[204] On June 17, 2016, Spears announced the release of her twentieth fragrance, Private Show.[406] As of January\u00a02018[update], Spears has released 24 fragrances through Elizabeth Arden.[407]\nThe singer founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[408] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[409] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1\u00a0million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[410] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[411] After the singer went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[412]\nOn October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name \"Artists Against AIDS Worldwide\", released a single titled \"What's Going On\", with the intention to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[413] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[414] Later in 2011, the singer raised $200,000 during An Evening of Southern Style at a private residence in Beverly Hills to benefit the St. Bernard Project, with the help of several celebrities, including Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Kellan Lutz and Kim Kardashian.[415] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[416] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[417] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[414]\nOn October 24, 2015, Spears donated $120,000 to the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.[418] In addition, $1 of each ticket sale for her Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, was donated to the nonprofit organization.[419] Spears also fundraised for the charity through social media, in addition to selling limited edition merchandise, with all proceeds going to the NCCF.[420] On October 27, 2016, Spears partnered with Zappos and XCYCLE to host the Britney Spears Piece of Me Charity Ride in Boca Park, Las Vegas to raise additional money toward her goal of $1\u00a0million for the NCCF, with $450,000 having already been raised from Spears's ticket sales and merchandise.[421] Participants were entered for a chance to win a spin class with Spears herself. The event ultimately went on to raise $553,130.[422] The fundraising ultimately led to the development of the NCCF Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas, which saw its grand opening on November 4, 2017.[423] Spears also regularly participates in Spirit Day to combat bullying of LGBTQ youth and bullying.[424]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nGeorge Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, he had previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. Bush is frequently referred to as George W. Bush, Bush Junior, or Bush 43 to distinguish him from his father, George H. W. Bush, who served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Bush is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, and the second son to become the American president after his father, the first being John Quincy Adams.[4] After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry.[5] Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected president of the United States in 2000 when he defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected president while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent.[6] In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush launched a \"War on Terror\" that began with the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and later expanded to the Iraq War in 2003. Signature legislation passed during his presidency included broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the Medicare Modernization Act, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. In the 2004 presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in a close election. After his re-election, Bush received criticism from across the political spectrum[7][8][9] for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,[10][11][12] and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the \"Great Recession\", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional approval for multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Bush was among the most popular, as well as unpopular, U.S. presidents in history; he received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but one of the lowest such ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.[13] Bush finished his second term in office in 2009 and returned to Texas. In 2010, he published his memoir, Decision Points.[14] His presidential library opened in 2013. His presidency has been rated below average in historians' polls, although his favorability ratings have improved since leaving office. George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, while his father was a student at Yale.[15] He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.[16] His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut.[17] His father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and some German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.[18] Bush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a prep school in Piney Point Village, Texas in the Houston area.[19] Bush attended high school at Phillips Academy, a boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and was the head cheerleader during his senior year.[20][21] He attended Yale University from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history.[22] During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year.[23][24][25] Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior.[26] Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV.[27] He characterized himself as an average student.[28] His GPA during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year.[29] After his application to the University of Texas School of Law was rejected, Bush entered Harvard Business School in the fall of 1973. He graduated in 1975 with an MBA degree. He is the only U.S. president to have earned an MBA.[30] Bush was initially engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967, but the engagement eventually fizzled out. Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship.[31] While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a schoolteacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year.[32] The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church.[33] On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.[32] Prior to getting married, Bush struggled with multiple episodes of alcohol abuse.[34] In one instance on September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was cited for DUI, fined $150 (equivalent to $674 in 2019), and got his Maine driver's license briefly suspended.[35] Bush said his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[32] and he attributes her influence to his 1986 decision to give up alcohol.[36] While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, \"I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.\"[32] Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.[37] He read 14 Lincoln biographies, and during the last three years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily,[38] though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is \"not a literalist\" about Bible interpretation.[39] Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing \"books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria\" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf.[40] After leaving the White House, Bush took up oil painting.[41] In May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard.[42] After two years of training in active-duty service,[43] he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base.[42][44] Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.[42] In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[45] In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. He had moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount.[46][47] In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.[48] He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.[49] In 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, although it did not begin operations until the following year.[50][51] He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman.[52] The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc.,[52][53] with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors.[52] Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[52][54] In April 1989, Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise for $89 million and invested $500,000 himself to start. He then served as managing general partner for five years.[55] He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans.[56] Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15\u00a0million from his initial $800,000 investment.[57] In 1978, Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.[58] Bush and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency.[59][60] He served as a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[52] In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign, as a \"campaign advisor\".[61] The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu he should resign.[62] Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time his brother Jeb sought the governorship of Florida. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement.[52] Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove.[63] After easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards.[52][64] In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor.[65] According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race \"featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record \u2013 when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs\".[66] The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,[67] but Rove denied being involved.[68] Bush won the general election with 53.5\u00a0percent against Richards' 45.9\u00a0percent.[69] Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.[63] He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence.[70] Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.[52] In 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),[71][72][73] which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S.[74][75][76] In 1998, Bush won re-election with a record[52] 69\u00a0percent of the vote.[77] He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[52] For most of Texas history, governors served two-year terms; a constitutional amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975.[78] In his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings.[52] He proclaimed June 10, 2000, to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he urged all Texans to \"answer the call to serve those in need\".[79] Throughout Bush's first term, he was the focus of national attention as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared, and within a year he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.[52] Incumbent Democratic president Bill Clinton was in his second and final term, and the field for nomination in both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President, joining John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith. Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.[52] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.[52] Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19\u00a0percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary, which\u2014according to The Boston Globe\u2014made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times described it as a smear campaign.[80][81][82] On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney\u2014a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. Representative, and Secretary of Defense\u2014to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party. Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.[52] During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al Gore, over gun control and taxation.[83] When the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount.[52] The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.[84] On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling,[85] the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[52] The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast.[86] Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.[86] In his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy.[87] Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[88] support for the USA PATRIOT Act,[89] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,[88][90] reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts,[88] creation of an ownership society,[88] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[91] Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants,[88] which was criticized by conservatives.[92] The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,[52] and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror. Following the resignation of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.[93] After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.[94] In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7\u00a0percent to his opponent's 48.3\u00a0percent).[95] Bush's father George H.W. Bush was the previous president who won an absolute majority of the popular vote; he accomplished that feat in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since Herbert Hoover's election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress. Bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks.[96] Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[97] steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[98] In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.[99] Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.[100] The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60\u00a0percent), while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14\u00a0percent, corporate tax revenues by 50\u00a0percent, and customs and duties by 40\u00a0percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107\u00a0percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62\u00a0percent, Medicare spending by 131\u00a0percent, social security by 51\u00a0percent, and income security spending by 130\u00a0percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35\u00a0percent and spending by 65\u00a0percent.[101] The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson.[102] The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.[103] The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion\u2014the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[104] In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6\u00a0trillion surplus over the next ten years.[105] Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35\u00a0trillion tax cut program\u2014one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[52] Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying \"the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.\"[52] Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.[106] Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security.[107] O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.[108] By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[52] Another tax cut was passed that year. Between 2001 and 2008, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125\u00a0percent,[109] less than for past business cycles.[110] Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.[111] Only four other U.S. presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began.[112] Unemployment originally rose from 4.2\u00a0percent in January 2001 to 6.3\u00a0percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5\u00a0percent in July 2007.[113] Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,[114] while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that \"Median real after-tax household income went up two percent\".[115] The poverty rate increased from 11.3\u00a0percent in 2000 to 12.3\u00a0percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7\u00a0percent in 2004.[116] By October 2008, due to increases in spending,[117]:273 the national debt had risen to $11.3\u00a0trillion,[118] an increase of over 100\u00a0percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6\u00a0trillion.[119][120] Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the \"Bush tax cuts\" and increased national security spending.[121] In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: \"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.\"[122] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2\u00a0percent.[123] In December 2007, the United States entered the longest post\u2013World War II recession,[99] caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value.[124] In February of 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record,[125] and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years.[126] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9\u00a0million jobs were lost.[127] By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6\u00a0million jobs.[128] To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170\u00a0billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003,[129] and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.[130][131][132] In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85\u00a0billion.[133] Many economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.[134][135] Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.[136] Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market.[137] Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said \"it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely\", and additionally, that it would have helped \"for Congress to have held hearings\".[131] Bush undertook a number of educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.[138] One of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.[139] It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[140] Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed \"No Child Left Behind\" into law.[141] Critics argue that it is underfunded[142] and that NCLBA's focus on \"high-stakes testing\" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[143] After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to Jan Crawford, resulted in \"the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years\" \u2013 the bill's costs approached $7\u00a0trillion.[117]:274 In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six\u00a0million to ten\u00a0million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[144] Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.[145] On May 21, 2008, Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).[146][147] The bill aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a person's genetic information. The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research. Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.[148] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400\u00a0billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \"better choices and more control over their health care\".[149] Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to \"reform\" Social Security,[150] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.[150] In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments.[150] Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[150] Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as \"Conversations on Social Security\" in an attempt to gain public support.[151] Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined,[152] and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.[153] The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn 2005 due to political fallout from the response to Hurricane Katrina.[154] After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office. Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80\u00a0percent of the world's population[155] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[156] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95\u20130 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol. In May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,[157] and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[158] In 2002, Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003,[159] which aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.[160] The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee. Later in 2006, Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument comprises 84\u00a0million acres (340,000\u00a0km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.[161] The move was hailed by conservationists for \"its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area\".[162] Bush has said he believes that global warming is real[163] and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a \"debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused\".[164] The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration[165] misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.[166] In his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \"America is addicted to oil\" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research.[167] In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.[168] Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling.[169] However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, \"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\"[169] Bush had said in June 2008, \"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells\u00a0... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\"[170] In his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2\u00a0billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, \"Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.\" He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, \"This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.\"[171] Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment in 1995.[172] Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research.[173] On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \"lines\" of stem cells,[174] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.[175] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.[176] Nearly 8\u00a0million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.[177] Almost half entered illegally.[178] In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12\u00a0million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a \"temporary guest-worker program\". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico\u2013United States border.[179] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration.[180] The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \"merit\" system for green cards; elimination of \"chain migration\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.[181] Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.[182] A heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.[183] The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46\u201353 vote.[184] Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.[185] The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.[186] On September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.[187] Hurricane Katrina struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.[188] Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27[189] and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day.[190] He authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action.[191] The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana,[192] officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort. On August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it \"an incident of national significance\",[193] triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans.[194] The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was \"not enough\".[195] As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown;[196] it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War[197] and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.[198][199] Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.[194] It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.[200] During Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys.[201] The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance.[202] Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department.[203][204] The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.[205] Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.[206] On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.[207] In all, twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales[208] and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson,[209] Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling,[210] aide to the president Karl Rove[211] and his senior aide Sara Taylor.[212] In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers[213] and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten[214] were both found in contempt of Congress.[212] In 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings,[215] the firings were \"inappropriately political\", but not criminal. According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.[216] During his presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \"nation-building\" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a national missile defense.[217] Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.[218] After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an \"axis of evil\" consisting of Iraq, Iran and North Korea.[219] In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.[220] Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.[221] In March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited the Republic of India in a trip focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy, counter-terrorism co-operation; and discussions that would eventually lead to the India\u2013United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.[222][223] This was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as \"sanctions and hectoring\".[224] Midway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.[225] In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show \"unity of purpose with America\", and said \"America has no truer friend than Great Britain.\"[226] The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: \"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\"[227] In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to \"hand over the terrorists, or\u00a0... share in their fate\".[228] After September 11, Bush announced a global War on Terror. The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden, so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime.[229] In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an \"axis of evil\" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was \"arming to threaten the peace of the world\" and \"pose[d] a grave and growing danger\".[230] The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war.[231] This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks.[232] Dissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.[233][234][235] In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for jihadists\".[236][237] On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[238] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[238] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai.[239][240] In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that \"our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade\" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.[241] Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.[242] It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains at large. Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.[243] The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned.[244] In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success.[245][246][247] As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.[248] Beginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" allied with terrorists and posing \"a grave and growing danger\" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction.[230][249] In the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.[250][251] Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.[252][253] In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.[254] The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.[255] More than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the \"coalition of the willing\" joined the United States[256] in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" speech was later criticized as premature.[257] From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq.[258] Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was \"grave and deteriorating\". While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq,[259] he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.[260][261] According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.[262] In January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years.[263] According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, \"This is the greatest day in the history of this country.\"[263] Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis \"have taken rightful control of their country's destiny\".[263] This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as president and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds.[264] On January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2\u00a0billion (equivalent to $1.5\u00a0billion in 2019) for these programs.[265] On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops,[266] saying the debate over the conflict was \"understandable\" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.[267] In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's \"bold decision\" to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it \"a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq\".[268] He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections.[269] By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began,[270] and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces.[270] Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush issued an executive order that authorized the President's Surveillance Program. The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S. and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[271] As of 2009[update], the other provisions of the program remained highly classified.[272] Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[273] The program proved to be controversial; critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal.[274] In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional,[275] but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.[276] On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.[277] Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, which was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.[278] This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post[278] and The Guardian[279] emerged in June 2013.[278] Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture.[280][281][282][283] Between 2002 and 2003, the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture, which was described as \"an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war\".[284][285] The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn.[286] While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert \"that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information\",[284] the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations \"provided critical information\" to preserve American lives.[287] Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, \"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.\"[288] On October 17, 2006, Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law.[289] The new rule was enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006),[290] which allowed the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denied the detainees access to habeas corpus and barred the torture of prisoners. The provision of the law allowed the president to determine what constitutes \"torture\".[289] On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082,[291] a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that \"the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror\".[292] In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics.[293] One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.[294] Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an \"axis of evil\". He said that \"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\"[230] Within months, \"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.\u2013DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\"[295] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \"[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\".[230] Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\", and said that \"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\", for which North Korea would be held accountable.[296] On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China.[297] On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.[298] By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.[299] On June 22, 2010, \"While South Korea prospers, the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly,\" he said, adding that communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression. \"In recent years,\" he went on to say, \"the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs.\"[300] Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria.[301] In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria. In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction[302] and being supportive of terrorism.[303] Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004\u20132005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.[304] In the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Bush announced $15\u00a0billion for this effort[305] which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide.[306] The U.S. government had spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7\u00a0billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization),[307] which saved an estimated five million lives.[308] According to The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker, \"Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.\"[308] On May 10, 2005, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking at Freedom Square in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby. It landed in the crowd about 65 feet (20\u00a0m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005, confessed, was convicted and was given a life sentence in January 2006.[309] Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Russia. He also signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia. Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death. In July 2001, Bush visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo.[310] Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.[311] Bush said an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but he opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. On June 10, 2007, Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania.[312] Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo.[313] Bush opposed South Ossetia's independence.[314] On August 15, 2008, Bush said of Russia's invasion of the country of Georgia: \"Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century.\"[315] Bush opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: \"On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games.\"[316] In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing.[317] Bush twice invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which allows a president to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the vice president, who then becomes acting president. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section\u00a03 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick Cheney the acting president. The medical procedure began at 7:09\u00a0am. EDT and ended at 7:29\u00a0am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24\u00a0am. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section\u00a03 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the acting president. Bush invoked Section\u00a03 at 7:16\u00a0a.m. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21\u00a0a.m. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section\u00a03 when he transferred the presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.[318] Following the announcement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated John Roberts to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005. On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,[117]:278 Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.[319] In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Bush experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies. Debate during one confirmation session lasted \"39 stupefying hours\" according to The New York Times. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in status quo, returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.[320][321][322] At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the \"Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings\" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites The New York Times as saying \"Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny.\"[323] The Senate had confirmed only eight of Bush's 60 judicial nominations by October 2001. In February 2003, the Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of Miguel Estrada.[324] Bush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations on his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image.[325][326] \"I think people look at him and think John Wayne\", said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror.[327] Bush has been parodied by the media,[328] comedians, and other politicians.[329] Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms.[330] In contrast to his father\u2014who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme\u2014Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.[331] Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is \"ludicrous\" and that Bush is \"very smart\".[332] In an interview with Playboy, The New York Times columnist David Brooks said Bush \"was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so puts on a Texas act.\"[333] Bush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50\u00a0percent.[334] After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90\u00a0percent,[335] maintaining 80 to 90\u00a0percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50\u00a0percent during most of his first term[13] and then fell to as low as 19\u00a0percent in his second term.[336] In 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe \"has done the most to influence the events of the year\".[337] In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89\u00a0percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush.[338] However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs.[339] Within the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections.[340] While 73\u00a0percent of military personnel said they would vote for Bush, 18\u00a0percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry.[340] According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.[340] Bush's approval rating went below the 50\u00a0percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004.[341] Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum[7][8][9] for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina,[10][11][12] and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies.[342] Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37\u00a0percent approval ratings for Bush,[343] the lowest for any second-term president at that point in his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28\u00a0percent),[341][344] which contributed to what Bush called the \"thumping\" of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections.[345] Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;[346] the average for his entire second term was 37\u00a0percent, according to Gallup.[347] By the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19\u00a0percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans.[336] Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being \"the worst president,\"[348][349] Bush would say, \"I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls.\"[350] There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action.[351] The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy,[352] the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions.[353] Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was \"off the table\".[354] In April of 2008, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll, with 69\u00a0percent of those polled disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28\u00a0percent approving\u2014although the majority (66\u00a0percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.[355] In polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20\u00a0percent,[356][357] while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67\u00a0percent to as high as 75\u00a0percent.[357][358] In polling conducted January 9\u201311, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34\u00a0percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24\u00a0percent).[359] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11\u201315, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22\u00a0percent, the lowest in American history.[356] Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization movements for his administration's foreign policy.[360][361] Views of him within the international community\u2014even in France, a close ally of the United States\u2014were more negative than those of most previous American presidents.[362] Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the United Kingdom and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.[363][364][365] Other leaders, such as Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan,[366] Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,[367] Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero of Spain,[368] and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela,[369] openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship.[370] In 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.[371][372] In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world.[373] The Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express \"a lot of confidence\" or \"some confidence\" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.[374] A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world.[375] During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim[376] Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8\u00a0million,[377] has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy.[378] A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him.[379][380] A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fush\u00eb-Kruj\u00eb, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana.[381] The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.[382] On May 7, 2005, during an official state visit to Latvia, Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga.[383] A few places outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president.[384] Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier.[385] A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Pun\u00ebtor\u00ebt e Rilindjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007.[386] In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.[387] In 2012, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO.[388] Two elementary schools are named after him: George W. Bush Elementary School of the Stockton Unified School District in Stockton, California,[389] and George W. Bush Elementary School of the Wylie Independent School District in St. Paul, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.[390] Following the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas, following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas.[391] They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, where they settled down.[392] He makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team's new stadium in Arlington[393] and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation.[394] He also attended every home playoff game for the Texas Rangers 2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31, 2010.[395] On August 6, 2013, Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent. The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination.[396] In reaction to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Bush stated: \"Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night. Murdering the innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives taken belong to those who protect our families and communities.\"[397] Since leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile[398] though he has made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011. In March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in Calgary, Alberta,[399][400] appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U.S. troops for earning a \"special place in American history,\"[401] and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy.[402] Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the \"Get Motivated\" seminar in Dallas.[403] In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting on November 5, 2009, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and the victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage.[404] Bush released his memoirs, Decision Points, on November 9, 2010. During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping \"the country safe amid a real danger\", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform.[405] He also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, \"I'd do it again to save lives.\"[406] In 2012, he wrote the foreword of The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.[407][408] He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas.[409] Bush appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, along with the former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, \"I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor.\"[410] Despite this statement, on April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Obama at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: \"You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That's how Americans should view the deal.\" Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a \"strategic blunder\", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.[411] Alongside the 2014 United States\u2013Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS more difficult.[412] Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.[413][414] On November 2, 2014, Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C.[38][415] Bush published a biography of his father, George Bush, called 41: A Portrait of My Father. It was released on November 11, 2014.[416] In an interview published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said \"boots on the ground\" would be needed in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He added that people had said during his presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, and that they indeed were defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining Obama.[417] In February 2016, George W. Bush spoke and campaigned for his brother Jeb Bush in South Carolina during a rally for the Jeb Bush presidential campaign in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries.[418] While Bush endorsed the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, he declined to endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump[419] and he did not attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump.[420] On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, \"I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president.\"[421][422] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank.[423] After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory.[424] Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.[425] While leaving the event, Bush allegedly described the ceremony as \"some weird shit\".[426] In February 2017, Bush released a book of his own portraits of veterans called Portraits of Courage (full title: Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warriors).[427] Following the white nationalist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bush and his father released a joint statement condemning the violence and ideologies present at the rally; \"America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms. As we pray for Charlottesville, we are all reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights. We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country.\"[428] Their statement came as President Trump was facing controversy over his statements about the rally. Subsequently, Bush gave a speech in New York where he noted of the current political climate, \"Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.\" He continued, \"Bigotry in any form is blasphemy against the American creed and it means the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation,\" while urging citizens to oppose threats to American democracy and be positive role models for young people.[429] The speech was widely interpreted as a denouncement of Donald Trump and his ideologies, despite Bush not mentioning Trump by name.[429][430][431][432] In April 2018, Bush and his father met in Texas with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.[433] In May 2019, on the 10th anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's passing, George Bush visited South Korea to pay respects to Roh and gave a short eulogy.[434] In January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month.[435] On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed.[436] The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who had lost five sons during the Civil War.[437] On September 7, 2017, Bush partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[438] Over the years, President Bush has had a good natured friendship with Michelle Obama. \"President Bush and I, we are forever seatmates because of protocol, and that's how we sit at all the official functions,\" Obama told the Today Show. \"He's my partner in crime at every major thing where all the 'formers' gather. So we're together all the time.\" She later added, \"I love him to death. He's a wonderful man, he's a funny man.\"[439] Bush and Obama have sat next to each other at many events including, the 50th anniversary of the historic civil rights march in Selma (2015), the interfaith memorial service for the victims in Dallas (2016), the opening at the National Museum of African American History and Culture (2016), and at the funerals for Nancy Reagan (2016), and John McCain (2018). Bush famously passed mints to Mrs. Obama during the McCain funeral and gave them to her again at his father, George H.W. Bush's funeral in 2018.[440] After serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby after reading Winston Churchill's essay \"Painting as a Pastime.\" Subjects have included people, dogs, and still life.[441] He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair.[442][443][444] In February 2017, Bush released a book of portraits of veterans, Portraits of Courage.[427] The net proceeds from his book are donated to the George W. Bush Presidential Center. In May 2019, on the 10th anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's passing, George Bush drew a portrait of Roh to give to his family.[445] President Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the U.S. after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion\u2014as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis\u2014as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.[449][450][451] Several historians and commentators hold that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a \"transformative\" one, and said that \"some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on\".[452] Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as \"the most noteworthy president since FDR\" and said the Patriot Act \"increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable\" as evidence.[453] Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the presidency of Ronald Reagan,[454] and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society.[455] Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.[456][457] The George W. Bush presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s.[458][459][460] A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.[461] Bush said in 2013, \"Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did.\"[462] Among the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that \"Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office.\"[463] Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40\u00a0percent in January 2009 and 35\u00a0percent in March 2009, to 45\u00a0percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.[464] Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.[465] In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47\u00a0percent approval and 50\u00a0percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53\u00a0percent) and the Iraq War (57\u00a0percent).[466] His 47\u00a0percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[467] A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55\u00a0percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43\u00a0percent of independents calling it a success.[468] Bush's public image saw greater improvement starting in 2017, which has been interpreted as Democrats viewing him more favorably in response to Donald Trump's presidency,[469][470] an assessment that has also been expressed by Bush himself.[471]",

A member of the Republican Party, he had previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. Bush is frequently referred to as George W. Bush, Bush Junior, or Bush 43 to distinguish him from his father, George H. W. Bush, who served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993.  \nBush is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, and the second son to become the American president after his father, the first being John Quincy Adams.[4] After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry.[5] Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected president of the United States in 2000 when he defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected president while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent.[6]\nIn response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush launched a \"War on Terror\" that began with the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and later expanded to the Iraq War in 2003. Signature legislation passed during his presidency included broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the Medicare Modernization Act, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. In the 2004 presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in a close election. After his re-election, Bush received criticism from across the political spectrum[7][8][9] for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,[10][11][12] and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the \"Great Recession\", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional approval for multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system.\nBush was among the most popular, as well as unpopular, U.S. presidents in history; he received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but one of the lowest such ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.[13] Bush finished his second term in office in 2009 and returned to Texas. In 2010, he published his memoir, Decision Points.[14] His presidential library opened in 2013. His presidency has been rated below average in historians' polls, although his favorability ratings have improved since leaving office.\nGeorge Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, while his father was a student at Yale.[15] He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.[16] His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut.[17] His father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and some German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.[18]\nBush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a prep school in Piney Point Village, Texas in the Houston area.[19]\nBush attended high school at Phillips Academy, a boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and was the head cheerleader during his senior year.[20][21] He attended Yale University from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history.[22] During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year.[23][24][25] Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior.[26] Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV.[27] He characterized himself as an average student.[28] His GPA during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year.[29]\nAfter his application to the University of Texas School of Law was rejected, Bush entered Harvard Business School in the fall of 1973. He graduated in 1975 with an MBA degree. He is the only U.S. president to have earned an MBA.[30]\nBush was initially engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967, but the engagement eventually fizzled out. Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship.[31] While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a schoolteacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year.[32] The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church.[33] On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.[32]\nPrior to getting married, Bush struggled with multiple episodes of alcohol abuse.[34] In one instance on September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was cited for DUI, fined $150 (equivalent to $674 in 2019), and got his Maine driver's license briefly suspended.[35]\nBush said his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[32] and he attributes her influence to his 1986 decision to give up alcohol.[36] While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, \"I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.\"[32]\nBush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories.[37] He read 14 Lincoln biographies, and during the last three years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily,[38] though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is \"not a literalist\" about Bible interpretation.[39] Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing \"books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria\" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf.[40] After leaving the White House, Bush took up oil painting.[41]\nIn May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard.[42] After two years of training in active-duty service,[43] he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base.[42][44] Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.[42] In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.[45]\nIn late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. He had moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount.[46][47] In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.[48] He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.[49]\nIn 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, although it did not begin operations until the following year.[50][51] He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman.[52] The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc.,[52][53] with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors.[52] Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[52][54]\nIn April 1989, Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise for $89 million and invested $500,000 himself to start. He then served as managing general partner for five years.[55] He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans.[56] Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15\u00a0million from his initial $800,000 investment.[57]\nIn 1978, Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.[58]\nBush and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency.[59][60] He served as a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[52] In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign, as a \"campaign advisor\".[61] The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu he should resign.[62]\nBush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time his brother Jeb sought the governorship of Florida. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement.[52] Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove.[63]\nAfter easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards.[52][64] In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor.[65] According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race \"featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record \u2013 when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs\".[66] The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,[67] but Rove denied being involved.[68] Bush won the general election with 53.5\u00a0percent against Richards' 45.9\u00a0percent.[69]\nBush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.[63] He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence.[70] Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.[52]\nIn 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),[71][72][73] which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S.[74][75][76]\nIn 1998, Bush won re-election with a record[52] 69\u00a0percent of the vote.[77] He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[52] For most of Texas history, governors served two-year terms; a constitutional amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975.[78] In his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings.[52] He proclaimed June 10, 2000, to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he urged all Texans to \"answer the call to serve those in need\".[79]\nThroughout Bush's first term, he was the focus of national attention as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared, and within a year he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.[52]\nIncumbent Democratic president Bill Clinton was in his second and final term, and the field for nomination in both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President, joining John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith.\nBush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.[52] By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.[52]\nBush won the Iowa caucuses, and although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19\u00a0percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary, which\u2014according to The Boston Globe\u2014made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times described it as a smear campaign.[80][81][82]\nOn July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney\u2014a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. Representative, and Secretary of Defense\u2014to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.\nBush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.[52] During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al Gore, over gun control and taxation.[83]\nWhen the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount.[52] The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.[84] On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling,[85] the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[52] The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast.[86] Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.[86]\nIn his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy.[87] Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,[88] support for the USA PATRIOT Act,[89] a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,[88][90] reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts,[88] creation of an ownership society,[88] and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.[91] Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants,[88] which was criticized by conservatives.[92]\nThe Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,[52] and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.\nFollowing the resignation of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.[93] After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.[94]\nIn the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7\u00a0percent to his opponent's 48.3\u00a0percent).[95] Bush's father George H.W. Bush was the previous president who won an absolute majority of the popular vote; he accomplished that feat in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since Herbert Hoover's election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.\nBush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks.[96] Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[97] steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[98] In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.[99]\nBush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.[100] The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy.\nHis administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60\u00a0percent), while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14\u00a0percent, corporate tax revenues by 50\u00a0percent, and customs and duties by 40\u00a0percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107\u00a0percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62\u00a0percent, Medicare spending by 131\u00a0percent, social security by 51\u00a0percent, and income security spending by 130\u00a0percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35\u00a0percent and spending by 65\u00a0percent.[101] The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson.[102] The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.[103]\nThe surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion\u2014the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[104] In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6\u00a0trillion surplus over the next ten years.[105] Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35\u00a0trillion tax cut program\u2014one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[52] Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying \"the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.\"[52] Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs.[106] Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security.[107] O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts.[108] By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[52] Another tax cut was passed that year.\nBetween 2001 and 2008, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125\u00a0percent,[109] less than for past business cycles.[110] Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.[111] Only four other U.S. presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began.[112]\nUnemployment originally rose from 4.2\u00a0percent in January 2001 to 6.3\u00a0percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5\u00a0percent in July 2007.[113] Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007,[114] while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that \"Median real after-tax household income went up two percent\".[115] The poverty rate increased from 11.3\u00a0percent in 2000 to 12.3\u00a0percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7\u00a0percent in 2004.[116] By October 2008, due to increases in spending,[117]:273 the national debt had risen to $11.3\u00a0trillion,[118] an increase of over 100\u00a0percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6\u00a0trillion.[119][120] Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the \"Bush tax cuts\" and increased national security spending.[121] In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: \"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.\"[122] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2\u00a0percent.[123]\nIn December 2007, the United States entered the longest post\u2013World War II recession,[99] caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value.[124] In February of 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record,[125] and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years.[126] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9\u00a0million jobs were lost.[127] By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6\u00a0million jobs.[128]\nTo aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170\u00a0billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003,[129] and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.[130][131][132] In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85\u00a0billion.[133]\nMany economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.[134][135] Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.[136] Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market.[137] Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said \"it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely\", and additionally, that it would have helped \"for Congress to have held hearings\".[131]\nBush undertook a number of educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.[138]\nOne of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.[139] It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[140] Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed \"No Child Left Behind\" into law.[141] Critics argue that it is underfunded[142] and that NCLBA's focus on \"high-stakes testing\" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[143]\nAfter being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to Jan Crawford, resulted in \"the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years\" \u2013 the bill's costs approached $7\u00a0trillion.[117]:274 In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six\u00a0million to ten\u00a0million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[144] Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.[145]\nOn May 21, 2008, Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).[146][147] The bill aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a person's genetic information. The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research.\nFollowing Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.[148] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400\u00a0billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \"better choices and more control over their health care\".[149]\nBush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to \"reform\" Social Security,[150] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.[150] In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments.[150] Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[150]\nBush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as \"Conversations on Social Security\" in an attempt to gain public support.[151] Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined,[152] and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.[153] The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn 2005 due to political fallout from the response to Hurricane Katrina.[154] After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.\nUpon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80\u00a0percent of the world's population[155] and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[156] He also cited that the Senate had voted 95\u20130 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.\nIn May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,[157] and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[158]\nIn 2002, Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003,[159] which aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.[160] The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.\nLater in 2006, Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument comprises 84\u00a0million acres (340,000\u00a0km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.[161] The move was hailed by conservationists for \"its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area\".[162]\nBush has said he believes that global warming is real[163] and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a \"debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused\".[164] The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration[165] misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.[166]\nIn his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \"America is addicted to oil\" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research.[167]\nIn his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.[168] Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling.[169] However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, \"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\"[169] Bush had said in June 2008, \"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells\u00a0... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\"[170]\nIn his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2\u00a0billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, \"Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.\" He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, \"This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.\"[171]\nFederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment in 1995.[172] Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research.[173] On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \"lines\" of stem cells,[174] but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.[175] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.[176]\nNearly 8\u00a0million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history.[177] Almost half entered illegally.[178] In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12\u00a0million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a \"temporary guest-worker program\". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico\u2013United States border.[179] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration.[180] The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \"merit\" system for green cards; elimination of \"chain migration\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor.[181] Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.[182]\nA heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.[183] The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46\u201353 vote.[184] Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.[185] The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.[186]\nOn September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.[187]\nHurricane Katrina struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.[188]\nBush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27[189] and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day.[190] He authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action.[191] The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana,[192] officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.\nOn August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it \"an incident of national significance\",[193] triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans.[194] The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was \"not enough\".[195]\nAs the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown;[196] it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War[197] and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.[198][199] Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.[194] It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.[200]\nDuring Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys.[201] The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance.[202] Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department.[203][204] The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.[205]\nAlthough Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.[206] On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.[207]\nIn all, twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales[208] and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson,[209] Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling,[210] aide to the president Karl Rove[211] and his senior aide Sara Taylor.[212] In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers[213] and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten[214] were both found in contempt of Congress.[212]\nIn 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings,[215] the firings were \"inappropriately political\", but not criminal. According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.[216]\nDuring his presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \"nation-building\" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a national missile defense.[217] Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.[218]\nAfter the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an \"axis of evil\" consisting of Iraq, Iran and North Korea.[219] In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.[220] Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.\nBush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.[221]\nIn March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited the Republic of India in a trip focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy, counter-terrorism co-operation; and discussions that would eventually lead to the India\u2013United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.[222][223] This was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as \"sanctions and hectoring\".[224]\nMidway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.[225]\nIn an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show \"unity of purpose with America\", and said \"America has no truer friend than Great Britain.\"[226]\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: \"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\"[227]\nIn a September 20 speech, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to \"hand over the terrorists, or\u00a0... share in their fate\".[228]\nAfter September 11, Bush announced a global War on Terror. The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden, so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime.[229] In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an \"axis of evil\" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was \"arming to threaten the peace of the world\" and \"pose[d] a grave and growing danger\".[230] The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war.[231] This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks.[232]\nDissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.[233][234][235] In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for jihadists\".[236][237]\nOn October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,[238] but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[238] Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai.[239][240] In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that \"our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade\" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.[241]\nEfforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.[242] It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains at large.\nDespite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.[243] The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned.[244] In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success.[245][246][247] As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.[248]\nBeginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" allied with terrorists and posing \"a grave and growing danger\" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction.[230][249]\nIn the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.[250][251] Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.[252][253]\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.[254] The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.[255]\nMore than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the \"coalition of the willing\" joined the United States[256] in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" speech was later criticized as premature.[257] From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq.[258] Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was \"grave and deteriorating\". While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq,[259] he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.[260][261] According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.[262]\nIn January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years.[263] According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, \"This is the greatest day in the history of this country.\"[263] Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis \"have taken rightful control of their country's destiny\".[263] This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as president and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds.[264]\nOn January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2\u00a0billion (equivalent to $1.5\u00a0billion in 2019) for these programs.[265] On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops,[266] saying the debate over the conflict was \"understandable\" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.[267]\nIn March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's \"bold decision\" to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it \"a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq\".[268] He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections.[269] By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began,[270] and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces.[270]\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush issued an executive order that authorized the President's Surveillance Program. The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S. and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[271] As of 2009[update], the other provisions of the program remained highly classified.[272] Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[273] The program proved to be controversial; critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal.[274] In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional,[275] but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.[276] On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.[277] Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, which was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.[278] This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post[278] and The Guardian[279] emerged in June 2013.[278]\nBush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture.[280][281][282][283] Between 2002 and 2003, the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture, which was described as \"an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war\".[284][285] The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn.[286] While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert \"that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information\",[284] the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations \"provided critical information\" to preserve American lives.[287] Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, \"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.\"[288]\nOn October 17, 2006, Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law.[289] The new rule was enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006),[290] which allowed the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denied the detainees access to habeas corpus and barred the torture of prisoners. The provision of the law allowed the president to determine what constitutes \"torture\".[289]\nOn March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082,[291] a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that \"the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror\".[292] In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics.[293] One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.[294]\nBush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an \"axis of evil\". He said that \"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\"[230] Within months, \"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.\u2013DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\"[295] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \"[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\".[230] Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\", and said that \"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\", for which North Korea would be held accountable.[296] On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China.[297] On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.[298] By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.[299]\nOn June 22, 2010, \"While South Korea prospers, the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly,\" he said, adding that communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression. \"In recent years,\" he went on to say, \"the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs.\"[300]\nBush expanded economic sanctions on Syria.[301] In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria. In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction[302] and being supportive of terrorism.[303] Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004\u20132005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.[304]\nIn the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Bush announced $15\u00a0billion for this effort[305] which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide.[306] The U.S. government had spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7\u00a0billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization),[307] which saved an estimated five million lives.[308] According to The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker, \"Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.\"[308]\nOn May 10, 2005, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking at Freedom Square in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby. It landed in the crowd about 65 feet (20\u00a0m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005, confessed, was convicted and was given a life sentence in January 2006.[309]\nBush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Russia. He also signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia.\nBush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.\nIn July 2001, Bush visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo.[310]\nBush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.[311] Bush said an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but he opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.\nOn June 10, 2007, Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania.[312] Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo.[313] Bush opposed South Ossetia's independence.[314] On August 15, 2008, Bush said of Russia's invasion of the country of Georgia: \"Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century.\"[315]\nBush opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: \"On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games.\"[316] In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing.[317]\nBush twice invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which allows a president to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the vice president, who then becomes acting president. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section\u00a03 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick Cheney the acting president. The medical procedure began at 7:09\u00a0am. EDT and ended at 7:29\u00a0am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24\u00a0am. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section\u00a03 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the acting president. Bush invoked Section\u00a03 at 7:16\u00a0a.m. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21\u00a0a.m. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section\u00a03 when he transferred the presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.[318]\nFollowing the announcement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated John Roberts to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.\nOn October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,[117]:278 Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.[319]\nIn addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Bush experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies. Debate during one confirmation session lasted \"39 stupefying hours\" according to The New York Times. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in status quo, returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.[320][321][322]\nAt the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the \"Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings\" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites The New York Times as saying \"Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny.\"[323]\nThe Senate had confirmed only eight of Bush's 60 judicial nominations by October 2001. In February 2003, the Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of Miguel Estrada.[324]\nBush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations on his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image.[325][326] \"I think people look at him and think John Wayne\", said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror.[327]\nBush has been parodied by the media,[328] comedians, and other politicians.[329] Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms.[330]\nIn contrast to his father\u2014who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme\u2014Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.[331]\nTony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is \"ludicrous\" and that Bush is \"very smart\".[332] In an interview with Playboy, The New York Times columnist David Brooks said Bush \"was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so puts on a Texas act.\"[333]\nBush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50\u00a0percent.[334] After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90\u00a0percent,[335] maintaining 80 to 90\u00a0percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50\u00a0percent during most of his first term[13] and then fell to as low as 19\u00a0percent in his second term.[336]\nIn 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe \"has done the most to influence the events of the year\".[337] In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89\u00a0percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush.[338] However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs.[339]\nWithin the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections.[340] While 73\u00a0percent of military personnel said they would vote for Bush, 18\u00a0percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry.[340] According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.[340]\nBush's approval rating went below the 50\u00a0percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004.[341] Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum[7][8][9] for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina,[10][11][12] and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies.[342]\nAmid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37\u00a0percent approval ratings for Bush,[343] the lowest for any second-term president at that point in his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28\u00a0percent),[341][344] which contributed to what Bush called the \"thumping\" of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections.[345] Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;[346] the average for his entire second term was 37\u00a0percent, according to Gallup.[347]\nBy the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19\u00a0percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans.[336] Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being \"the worst president,\"[348][349] Bush would say, \"I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls.\"[350]\nThere were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action.[351] The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy,[352] the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions.[353] Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was \"off the table\".[354]\nIn April of 2008, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll, with 69\u00a0percent of those polled disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28\u00a0percent approving\u2014although the majority (66\u00a0percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.[355]\nIn polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20\u00a0percent,[356][357] while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67\u00a0percent to as high as 75\u00a0percent.[357][358] In polling conducted January 9\u201311, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34\u00a0percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24\u00a0percent).[359] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11\u201315, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22\u00a0percent, the lowest in American history.[356]\nBush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization movements for his administration's foreign policy.[360][361] Views of him within the international community\u2014even in France, a close ally of the United States\u2014were more negative than those of most previous American presidents.[362]\nBush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the United Kingdom and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained.[363][364][365] Other leaders, such as Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan,[366] Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,[367] Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero of Spain,[368] and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela,[369] openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship.[370]\nIn 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security.[371][372] In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world.[373] The Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express \"a lot of confidence\" or \"some confidence\" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.[374] A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world.[375]\nDuring a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim[376] Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8\u00a0million,[377] has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy.[378] A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him.[379][380] A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fush\u00eb-Kruj\u00eb, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana.[381] The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.[382]\nOn May 7, 2005, during an official state visit to Latvia, Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga.[383] A few places outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president.[384] Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier.[385] A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Pun\u00ebtor\u00ebt e Rilindjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007.[386] In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.[387]\nIn 2012, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO.[388]\nTwo elementary schools are named after him: George W. Bush Elementary School of the Stockton Unified School District in Stockton, California,[389] and George W. Bush Elementary School of the Wylie Independent School District in St. Paul, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.[390]\nFollowing the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas, following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas.[391] They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, where they settled down.[392]\nHe makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team's new stadium in Arlington[393] and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation.[394] He also attended every home playoff game for the Texas Rangers 2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31, 2010.[395]\nOn August 6, 2013, Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent. The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination.[396]\nIn reaction to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Bush stated: \"Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night. Murdering the innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives taken belong to those who protect our families and communities.\"[397]\nSince leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile[398] though he has made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011. In March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in Calgary, Alberta,[399][400] appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U.S. troops for earning a \"special place in American history,\"[401] and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy.[402] Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the \"Get Motivated\" seminar in Dallas.[403] In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting on November 5, 2009, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and the victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage.[404]\nBush released his memoirs, Decision Points, on November 9, 2010. During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping \"the country safe amid a real danger\", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform.[405] He also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, \"I'd do it again to save lives.\"[406]\nIn 2012, he wrote the foreword of The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.[407][408] He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas.[409]\nBush appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, along with the former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, \"I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor.\"[410] Despite this statement, on April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Obama at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: \"You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That's how Americans should view the deal.\" Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a \"strategic blunder\", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.[411]\nAlongside the 2014 United States\u2013Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS more difficult.[412]\nBush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.[413][414]\nOn November 2, 2014, Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C.[38][415]\nBush published a biography of his father, George Bush, called 41: A Portrait of My Father. It was released on November 11, 2014.[416]\nIn an interview published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said \"boots on the ground\" would be needed in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He added that people had said during his presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, and that they indeed were defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining Obama.[417]\nIn February 2016, George W. Bush spoke and campaigned for his brother Jeb Bush in South Carolina during a rally for the Jeb Bush presidential campaign in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries.[418]\nWhile Bush endorsed the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, he declined to endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump[419] and he did not attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump.[420] On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, \"I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president.\"[421][422] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank.[423] After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory.[424] Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.[425] While leaving the event, Bush allegedly described the ceremony as \"some weird shit\".[426]\nIn February 2017, Bush released a book of his own portraits of veterans called Portraits of Courage (full title: Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warriors).[427]\nFollowing the white nationalist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bush and his father released a joint statement condemning the violence and ideologies present at the rally; \"America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms. As we pray for Charlottesville, we are all reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights. We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country.\"[428] Their statement came as President Trump was facing controversy over his statements about the rally. Subsequently, Bush gave a speech in New York where he noted of the current political climate, \"Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.\" He continued, \"Bigotry in any form is blasphemy against the American creed and it means the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation,\" while urging citizens to oppose threats to American democracy and be positive role models for young people.[429] The speech was widely interpreted as a denouncement of Donald Trump and his ideologies, despite Bush not mentioning Trump by name.[429][430][431][432]\nIn April 2018, Bush and his father met in Texas with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.[433]\nIn May 2019, on the 10th anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's passing, George Bush visited South Korea to pay respects to Roh and gave a short eulogy.[434]\nIn January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month.[435]\nOn May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed.[436] The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who had lost five sons during the Civil War.[437]\nOn September 7, 2017, Bush partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[438]\nOver the years, President Bush has had a good natured friendship with Michelle Obama. \"President Bush and I, we are forever seatmates because of protocol, and that's how we sit at all the official functions,\" Obama told the Today Show. \"He's my partner in crime at every major thing where all the 'formers' gather. So we're together all the time.\" She later added, \"I love him to death. He's a wonderful man, he's a funny man.\"[439] Bush and Obama have sat next to each other at many events including, the 50th anniversary of the historic civil rights march in Selma (2015), the interfaith memorial service for the victims in Dallas (2016), the opening at the National Museum of African American History and Culture (2016), and at the funerals for Nancy Reagan (2016), and John McCain (2018). Bush famously passed mints to Mrs. Obama during the McCain funeral and gave them to her again at his father, George H.W. Bush's funeral in 2018.[440]\nAfter serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby after reading Winston Churchill's essay \"Painting as a Pastime.\" Subjects have included people, dogs, and still life.[441] He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair.[442][443][444] In February 2017, Bush released a book of portraits of veterans, Portraits of Courage.[427] The net proceeds from his book are donated to the George W. Bush Presidential Center. In May 2019, on the 10th anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's passing, George Bush drew a portrait of Roh to give to his family.[445]\nPresident Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the U.S. after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion\u2014as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis\u2014as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.[449][450][451]\nSeveral historians and commentators hold that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a \"transformative\" one, and said that \"some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on\".[452] Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as \"the most noteworthy president since FDR\" and said the Patriot Act \"increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable\" as evidence.[453] Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the presidency of Ronald Reagan,[454] and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society.[455] Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.[456][457]\nThe George W. Bush presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s.[458][459][460]\nA 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.[461] Bush said in 2013, \"Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did.\"[462]\nAmong the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that \"Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office.\"[463] Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40\u00a0percent in January 2009 and 35\u00a0percent in March 2009, to 45\u00a0percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.[464] Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement  in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.[465] In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47\u00a0percent approval and 50\u00a0percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53\u00a0percent) and the Iraq War (57\u00a0percent).[466] His 47\u00a0percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[467] A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55\u00a0percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43\u00a0percent of independents calling it a success.[468] Bush's public image saw greater improvement starting in 2017, which has been interpreted as Democrats viewing him more favorably in response to Donald Trump's presidency,[469][470] an assessment that has also been expressed by Bush himself.[471]\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nHillary Diane Rodham Clinton[2] (n\u00e9e Rodham; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer, and public speaker. She served as First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, as a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and as the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to Donald Trump. Raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the Clinton health care plan\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York. She was re-elected in 2006. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was damaged in the September 11 attacks.[3] In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. Clinton was U.S. secretary of state in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya. She was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Her use of a private e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the e-mail controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election. Upon leaving her Cabinet position after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements. Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College despite winning a plurality of the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups. Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois.[4][5] She was raised in a United Methodist family who first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[6] Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent,[7] and managed a small but successful textile business, which he had founded.[8] Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[7][9][10] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[11] As a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge.[12] She participated in swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[12] She has often told the story[13][14][15] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[16] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council and school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[4][17] She was elected class vice president for her junior year but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\".[18] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then-new Maine South High School. There she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted \"most likely to succeed.\" She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class.[19] Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career.[10] Her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[20] She was raised in a politically conservative household,[10] and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon,[21] and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[22] Rodham's early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[23] In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[24][25] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[26][27] As the leader of this \"Rockefeller Republican\"-oriented group,[28] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[29] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[26] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as \"a mind conservative and a heart liberal\".[30] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[31][32] By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[33] In early 1968 she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association, a position she held until early 1969.[31][34] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[33] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[31][35] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female president of the United States.[31] To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the \"Wellesley in Washington\" summer program.[33] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[33] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's \"veiled\" racist messages, and she left the Republican Party for good.[33] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[36] (Years later, while she was the first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[36]) In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[37] with departmental honors in political science.[36] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of the commencement speaker, Senator Edward Brooke.[34][38] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[31][39][40] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[41][42] because of the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[38] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[43] She was asked to speak at the 50th anniversary convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington, D.C., the next year.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).[45] Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital,[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey. Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52] In the spring of 1971, she began dating fellow law student Bill Clinton. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans and moved to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[37] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation, but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59] Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, \"Children Under the Law\", was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that \"child citizens\" were \"powerless individuals\"[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence on a case-by-case basis, except when there is evidence otherwise.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64] During her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for it.[67] The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67] By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.[68] Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, \"I chose to follow my heart instead of my head\".[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74] At the university, Rodham taught classes in criminal law. She was considered a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] Rodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] As a court-appointed lawyer, Rodham was required to act as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl; after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed, Rodham used an effective defense and counseled her client to plead guilty to a lesser charge. She has called the trial a \"terrible case\".[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married; she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost, and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else.[78] In 1974, Bill Clinton lost an Arkansas congressional race, facing incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt.[79] Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she agreed to marry him.[80] The wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[81] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] Her motivation was threefold. She wanted to keep the couple's professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, \"it showed that I was still me\".[83] The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional.[84] In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[85][86] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[79] In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[87] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while working pro bono in child advocacy;[88] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[89] Rodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles \"Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect\" in 1977[90] and \"Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective\" in 1979.[91] The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, \"Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.\"[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as \"one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades\".[92] Conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[93] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[94] In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[46][96] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[97] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation.[98] She held that position from 1978 until the end of 1981.[99] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to hold the job.[100] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90\u00a0million to $300\u00a0million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[88] Following her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979\u201381, 1983\u201392). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[101] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.[102] In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm.[103] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[104] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[105] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[106] At this time, the couple began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[105] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s. On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[107] Two years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to his job as governor of Arkansas after he won the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \"Hillary Clinton\", or sometimes \"Mrs. Bill Clinton\", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[108] During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.[114][115] In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[101][114] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][114] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[116] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[117][118] Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was the first lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours[119] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[120] The firm considered her a \"rainmaker\" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[120] Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[121] From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[122] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[123] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[124] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America\u2014in 1988 and in 1991.[125] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running. Private polls were unfavorable, however, and in the end he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[126] Clinton was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund[4][127] and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988\u201392)[128] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985\u201392),[129] Wal-Mart Stores (1986\u201392)[130] and Lafarge (1990\u201392).[131] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[120][132] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[132] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[130][132][133] According to Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump.[134][135] Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[136] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \"causing pain in my marriage\".[137] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[138] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song \"Stand by Your Man\".[d] Later in the campaign, she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers. In retrospect she admitted they were ill-considered. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \"get two for the price of one\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[144] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[93] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[145] When Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[146] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][147] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration. Her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[148] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[149][150] Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors, and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.[151] Bill Clinton's campaign promise of \"two for the price of one\" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as \"co-presidents\" or sometimes use the Arkansas label \"Billary\".[101][152][153] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into \"imaginary discussions\" with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[157][158] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's \"politics of meaning\" to overcome what she saw as America's \"sleeping sickness of the soul\"; that would lead to a willingness \"to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium\".[159][160] In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[161] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[162][163] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as \"Hillarycare\" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress.[164] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[164] Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[165] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors. The first lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50 percent range during her first year, fell to 44\u00a0percent in April 1994 and 35\u00a0percent by September 1994.[166] Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[167] They saw a net gain of 54 seats in the House election and eight in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[168] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.[169] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use \"Hillarycare\" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[170] Along with senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. This federal bill gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage. She conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[171] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[172] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. She worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60] Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency. When the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare, however, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[173][174] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[173] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[173][174] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called \"sad and painful\".[174] Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as the first lady.[60][175] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[175] As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences. These included one on Child Care (1997),[176] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[177] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[178] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000),[179] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[180] Clinton traveled to 79\u00a0countries during this time,[181] breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon.[182] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[183] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department, without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[184] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited, and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[185] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[186] In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself. She declared, \"it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights\".[187] Delegates from over 180\u00a0countries heard her say: \"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all.\"[188] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[181][188] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.[189] During the late 1990s, she was one of the most prominent international figures to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[190][191] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[192] It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[193] Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press. The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from its publication in a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[194] and throughout her time as the first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[195] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed, and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators her husband had appointed.[194] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[196] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[197][198] After a two-year search, the records were found in the first lady's White House book room and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[198] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[198] Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.[199] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first spouse of a U.S. president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[197] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[200] Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an action that became known as \"Travelgate\", began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[201] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo led to the investigation being focused on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[202][203] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made \"factually false\" statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[204] In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed that Clinton had earned spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978\u201379.[205] The press made allegations that Clinton had engaged in a conflict of interest and disguised a bribery. Several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[206] An outgrowth of the \"Travelgate\" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called \"Filegate\".[207] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[208] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[207] In early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property. During the last year of Bill Clinton's time in office, those gifts were shipped to the Clintons' private residence.[209][210] In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book,[211] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies.[212][213] The book spent 18\u00a0weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.[214] By 2000, it had sold 450,000\u00a0copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback.[215] Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording.[216] She was the first president's wife to win a Grammy Award.[217] In 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[218] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\".[219][220] She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.[222] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage. Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage.[223] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[224] Public reaction varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[225] In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70\u00a0percent, the highest they had ever been.[225] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to \"a love that has persisted for decades\" and add: \"No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.\"[226] Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills. In 2014, Hillary would say she and Bill had left the White House \"not only dead broke, but in debt\". The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who give paid speeches after leaving office. The couple would also have the ability to secure loans from banks.[227] Other books published by Clinton when she was the first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat.[228] She was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites.[229] This included the flag that inspired \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She also published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled \"Talking It Over\" from 1995 to 2000.[230][231] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[4] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[232] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[233] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned by museums.[234] In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe,[235] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[236] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[237] These included changing of the Treaty Room and a presidential study to have a 19th-century look.[236] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[237] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60] When New York's long-serving U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[238] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[239] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[240] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani\u2014the mayor of New York City\u2014as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public. Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.[241] Bill de Blasio was Clinton's campaign manager. She began her drive to the U.S. Senate by visiting all 62 counties in the state, in a \"listening tour\" of small-group settings.[242] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000\u00a0jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[243] The contest drew national attention. During a September debate, Lazio blundered when he seemed to invade Clinton's personal space by trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[244] Their campaigns, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90\u00a0million.[245] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55\u00a0percent of the vote to Lazio's 43\u00a0percent.[244] She was sworn in as U.S. senator on January 3, 2001.[246] Publisher Simon & Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8\u00a0million in December 2000 for her autobiography, released in 2003, as Living History.[247] Upon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[248] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[157][249] She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001\u201302),[250] Committee on Armed Services (2003\u201309),[251] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001\u201309), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001\u201309)[250] and Special Committee on Aging.[252] She was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[253] (2001\u201309).[254] Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21\u00a0billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment.[255] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[256] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties.[257] In March 2006 she voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 that had gained large majority support.[258] Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[259] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[260] After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[261] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000\u00a0soldiers to ease the strain.[262] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay \"until the job is done\" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis \"an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves\".[263] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[264] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[265][266] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[266] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying she \"got it wrong\" and the vote in support had been a \"mistake\".[267]) Clinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[268] Simon & Schuster released Living History:[247] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[269] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[270] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[271] Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[272] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as chief justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[273][274] In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[275] Along with senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[268][276] Looking to establish a \"progressive infrastructure\" to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff John Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[277] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[278] In November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term. She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[279] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[280] Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former Mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67\u00a0percent of the vote to Spencer's 31\u00a0percent,[281] carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties.[282] Her campaign spent $36\u00a0million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[283] In the following months, she transferred $10\u00a0million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[284] Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful).[h] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[286] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80\u201314 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[287] She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, \"I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.\"[288] In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[289] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[290] As the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700\u00a0billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74\u201325.[291] In 2007, Clinton and Virginia senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[292] Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. president since at least early 2003.[293] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \"I'm in and I'm in to win.\"[294] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50\u00a0million.[295] They had earned over $100\u00a0million since 2000\u2014most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities.[296] Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[260] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[260] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[297] At the end of October, Clinton fared poorly in her debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[298][299] Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton's message of experience.[300] In the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January\u00a03 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards.[301] Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary.[302] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, narrowly defeating Obama.[303] It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.[304] Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.[305] The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[306] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[i] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[307] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[306][308] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[308] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February\u00a05 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign, and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president \"needs to stop\".[309] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[310] On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[311] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[312] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[313] The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[300][314] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff, and she made several top-level personnel changes.[314][315] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[313][314] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[314] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[316] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare.[300][313] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[317][318] Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[319] Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[320] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[321] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640\u00a0pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763;[322] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395,[323] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[322] Clinton and Obama each received over 17\u00a0million votes during the nomination process[j] with both breaking the previous record.[324] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[304] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[325] Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13\u00a0million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[326] In mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration.[327] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position.[328][329] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state.[330][331] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\".[331] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.[332] The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[333] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the committee voted 16\u20131 to approve Clinton.[334] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65\u00a0percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[335] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94\u20132.[336] Clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state, resigning from the Senate later that day.[337] She became the first former first lady to be a member of the United States Cabinet.[338] Clinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: \"We have a lot of damage to repair.\"[339] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department, and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[340] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[341] The first such review was issued in late 2010. It called for the U.S. leading through \"civilian power\" as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises.[342] It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world.[188] A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[328] In a 2009 internal debate regarding the War in Afghanistan, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal \"Afghanistan surge\", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal. She prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[266][343] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a \"reset button\" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[344][345] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office.[344] Relations would worsen considerably, however, following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012.[346] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish\u2013Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[347][348] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[186][k] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[328][350][351] Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[352][353] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[354] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[328] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[353] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[355][356] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[328] In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[357] Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it. The speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[358] In July 2010, she visited South Korea, where she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the Caracol Industrial Park would have a key tenant.[359] This was part of the \"build back better\" program initiated by her husband, named UN Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 after a tropical storm season caused $1 billion in damages to the island.[360] In January 2011, Clinton traveled to Haiti in order to help pave the way for the election of Michel Martelly.[361] The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration.[362] Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was \"stable\", to a stance that there needed to be an \"orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government\", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[363][364] Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[362] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[365] As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power This was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[365][366][367] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. The State Department's legal advisor argued the same point when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[368] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called \"convening power\" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[366] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state.[369] The wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[370][371][372] During April 2011, internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[373][374] Following the completion of the mission on May\u00a02 resulting in bin Laden's death, Clinton played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[375] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000\u201320,000 U.S. troops there. (All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed.)[266][376] In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that, \"Gay rights are human rights\", and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[377] The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955. She met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[378][379] She also said the 21st century would be \"America's Pacific century\",[380] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's \"pivot to Asia\".[381] During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform. As government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, they called for him to resign from the presidency.[382] The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria.[383] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels. The proposal was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict, fearing that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[378][384] In December 2012, Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.[385] Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[385][386] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication, and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.[386][387][l] Throughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values. In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[366][392] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[393] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[266][354][376] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[394] Clinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-\u00e0-vis their governments.[366] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[188] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the \"Hillary Doctrine\", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state, and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[352][395] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[396] Clinton visited 112\u00a0countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[397][m] (Time magazine wrote that \"Clinton's endurance is legendary\".)[366] The first secretary of state to visit countries like Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[400] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[367] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor.[386] Her last day as secretary of state was February 1, 2013.[401] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had accomplished,[355][356] and highlighted her focus on goals she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[402] She has also been criticized for accepting millions in dollars in donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State.[403] On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[404] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[404][405] On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[406] It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[407] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[406] Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident, and while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[408] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate \"talking points\" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\"[408][409] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's response to the attack.[410] The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[411] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[411][412] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation.[411][413] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[414][415] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[414] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[416] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines.[411] The Republican report offered some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[412] A controversy arose in March 2015, when the State Department's inspector general revealed that Clinton had used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server exclusively\u2014instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers\u2014when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements.[417] The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[418][419] In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and \"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system\". They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[420] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[421] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called \"born classified\" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[422] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[423] Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails \"contained classified State Department information when originated\".[424] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[425] Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, \"I never sent or received any classified material\u2014they are retroactively classifying it.\" On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: \"Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\"[426][427] On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said: 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were \"up-classified\" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[423][428]Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small \"c\" in parentheses, described as \"portion markings\" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not \"technically sophisticated\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[428] The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Comey acknowledged that it was \"possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account\". He added that \"[although] we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\". Nevertheless, Comey asserted that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of \"potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information\". The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute.[423] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2014who had met privately with Bill Clinton on June 27[429][430]\u2014confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges.[431] On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails. Law enforcement officials said that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed the conclusion it had reached in July.[432] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[433] The emails controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election.[434][435][436] In September 2019, the State Department finished its internal review into 33,000 emails that Clinton had turned over. The investigation that began in 2016 found 588 violations of security procedures and found that Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information. In 91 cases, the culpability of sending classified information could be attributed to 38 people, but the review concluded there was \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\".[437][438] When Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years.[439] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[440] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600\u00a0million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[440][441] In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as secretary of state. As of July\u00a02015[update], the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[442] Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[443] its March 2015 report said that while \"There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman\u00a0... this data shows just how far we still have to go.\"[444] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state.[n] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[447] She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[448] There she received $200,000\u2013225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[448][449] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[448] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11\u00a0million from her speeches.[450] For the overall period 2007\u201314, the Clintons earned almost $141\u00a0million, paid some $56\u00a0million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15\u00a0million to charity.[451] As of 2015[update], she was estimated to be worth over $30\u00a0million on her own, or $45\u201353\u00a0million with her husband.[452] Clinton resigned from the board of the foundation in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign. The foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[n] On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[453] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[454] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[455] Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[456][457] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[453] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.[449][457] In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders\u2014[458][459] the first woman to win them.[458] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[460] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[461] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[462] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[461] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[461] On March 1 Super Tuesday, Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters. She opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[463] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout. Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents. Clinton did better among older, black and Hispanic voter populations, and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[464][465][466] By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[467] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn becoming the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[468] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47.[469] She received almost 17\u00a0million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13\u00a0million.[470] Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[471] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[472] Her opponents in the general election included Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Around the time of the convention, WikiLeaks released emails that suggested the DNC and the Clinton campaign tilted the primary in Clinton's favor. Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton were tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[473][474] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified government material.[475] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a three to four percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention. This was in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the low side by historical standards.[476][477][478] Following Clinton's seven percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[479][480] In fall 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States.[481] Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016, presidential election.[482] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win; media sources proclaimed him the winner.[483] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave his victory speech.[484] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying: \"We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.\"[485] Though Clinton lost the election by capturing only 232 electoral votes to Trump's 306, she won the popular vote by more than 2.8\u00a0million votes, or 2.1% of the voter base.[486][487] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[o][488][489] She won the most votes of any candidate who did not take office and the third-most votes of any candidate in history,[490][491] though she did not have the greatest percentage win of a losing candidate. (Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by 10.4% but lost to John Quincy Adams).[492] On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes being cast instead for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle, and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[493] In their respective capacities as a former president and a former first lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the inauguration of Donald Trump with their daughter, Chelsea. The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, \"I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country & its future.\"[494] Clinton delivered a St. Patrick's Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 2017, referring to reports of her being seen taking walks in the woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election.[495][496] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from \"the woods\" and become politically active again.[495] On March 24, 2017, after the postponement of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day \"a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance\" and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[497] She went on to call the American Health Care Act \"a disastrous bill\" during a San Francisco speech four days later.[498] After the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act on May 4, Clinton dubbed it a \"shameful failure of policy & morality by GOP\".[499] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, \"This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.\"[500] Clinton commented that she would not seek public office again in April.[501] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the U.S. should take out Bashar al-Assad's airfields and thereby \"prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them\".[502] In May 2017 Clinton announced the formation of Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote is \"dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election\".[503] In a June 2017 appearance at a Baltimore fundraiser for the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel (ECYP), Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: \"When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program's mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.\"[504] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, \"2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we're all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff & heroic police.\"[505] Clinton's third memoir, What Happened, an account of her devastating loss in the 2016 election, was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon & Schuster, in print, e-book, and as an audiobook read by the author.[506] A book tour and a series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[507] What Happened sold 300,000 copies in its first week,[508][509] less than her 2003 memoir, Living History, but triple the first-week sales of her previous memoir, 2014's Hard Choices.[508][510] Simon & Schuster announced that What Happened had sold more e-books in its first-week than any nonfiction e-book since 2010.[508] As of December 10, 2017, the book had sold 448,947 hardcover copies.[511] An announcement was made in February 2017 that efforts were under way to render her 1996 book It Takes a Village as a picture book.[512] Marla Frazee, a two-time winner of the Caldecott Medal, was announced as the illustrator.[512] Clinton had worked on it with Frazee during her 2016 presidential election campaign.[513] The result was published on the same day of publication as What Happened.[514][513] The book is aimed at preschool-aged children, although a few messages are more likely better understood by adults.[513] In October 2018, Hillary and Bill Clinton announced plans for a 13-city speaking tour in various cities in the United States and Canada between November 2018 and May 2019.[515] Hillary was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in law (LLD) at Queen's University Belfast on October 10, 2018, after giving a speech on Northern Ireland and the impacts of Brexit at Whitla Hall, Belfast.[516] In June 2018, Trinity College Dublin awarded her with an honorary doctorate (LLD).[517] A package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Clinton's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. It was intercepted by the Secret Service. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders and to CNN.[518][519] On March 4, 2019, Clinton announced that she would not run for president in 2020.[520] In October 2019, Trump tweeted that Clinton should run for a third time, prompting her response of \"don't tempt me\".[521] On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indian men by Adam Purinton.[522] On May 2, Clinton said Trump's use of Twitter \"doesn't work\" when pursuing important negotiations. \"Kim Jong Un\u00a0... [is] always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position\". Negotiations with North Korea should not take place without \"a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.\"[523] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump's 2018 budget proposal was \"a con\" for underfunding domestic programs.[524] On June 1, when President Trump announced withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a \"historic mistake\".[525] On September 29, 2019, in an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Clinton described Trump as a \"threat\" to the country's standing in the world, an \"illegitimate president\", despite having won the election, and a \"corrupt human tornado\".[526] On January 2, 2020, it was announced that Hillary Clinton would take up the position of Chancellor at Queen's University Belfast after her husband had previously played a role in the Northern Ireland peace process and the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Clinton became the 11th and first female chancellor of the university, filling the position that had been vacant since 2018 after the death of her predecessor, Thomas J. Moran. Commenting on taking up the position, she said that \u201cthe university is making waves internationally for its research and impact and I am proud to be an ambassador and help grow its reputation for excellence\". Queen's Pro-Chancellor Stephen Prenter said that Clinton on her appointment \"will be an incredible advocate for Queen's\" who can act as an \"inspirational role model\".[527][528] Using her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically. National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of\u00a01 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[529] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[530] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[531] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75\u00a0liberal, 23\u00a0conservative; Social = 83\u00a0liberal, 6\u00a0conservative; Foreign = 66\u00a0liberal, 30\u00a0conservative. Total average = 75\u00a0liberal, 20\u00a0conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, \"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.\"[532] Organizations have also attempted to provide more recent assessments of Clinton after she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in the \"Left Liberal\" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances, with an economic score of ten on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[533] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[534] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90\u00a0percent \"Liberal Quotient\" from Americans for Democratic Action,[535] and a lifetime eight\u00a0percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[536] In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \"optimistic\" and \"wide-ranging\". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \"clawback\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[537] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as \"the gold standard\"[538] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that \"any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\".[539][540] As senator (2001\u20132009), her record on trade was mixed; she voted in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[539] Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit \"unaccountable money\" in politics.[541] In July 2016, she \"committed\" to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[542][543] On December 7, 2015, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities in the New York Times.[544] Accepting the scientific consensus on climate change, Clinton supports cap-and-trade,[545] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[546] She supported \"equal pay for equal work\", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[547] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[541] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a \"fair share surcharge\".[548] Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act[549] and would have added a \"public option\" that competed with private insurers and enabled people \"50 or 55 and up\" to buy into Medicare.[550][551] On LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage.[541] In 2013, Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage; in 2000, she was against such marriages altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages.[552] In 2000, she was the first spouse of a US president to march in an LGBT pride parade.[553] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[554] Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship \"[i]s at its heart a family issue\",[555] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[556][557] However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border \"should be sent back.\"[558] She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[559] Expressing support for Common Core[560] she said, \"The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized\u00a0... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.\"[561] On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002,[562] a vote she later \"regretted\".[563] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[564] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[565][566] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[559] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \"America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.\"[567] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[568][569] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[570] In 2000, Clinton advocated for the elimination of the electoral college.[571] She promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it, resulting in the direct election of the president.[572][573] Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church: Clinton discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[574] However, she has seldom discussed her faith while campaigning.[575][576] She has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and \"creating opportunities for others to be lifted up\".[576] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that \"Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.\"[576] Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.\"[575] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy \"made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith\".[577] Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found \"a virtual cottage industry\" of \"anti-Clinton literature\" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints. Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless\u00a0... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[578] (other than her memoirs and those of her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[579] Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \"bogeyman\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[580] Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture in a wide spectrum of perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[581] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, \"Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.\"[582] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as the first lady. She has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelg\u00e4ngers.[583][584] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her including \"The Hillary Shimmy Song\", which went viral.[585][586][587][588] She has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, though some argue otherwise.[589] In the early stages of her 2008 presidential campaign, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her with two checkboxes labeled \"Love Her\", \"Hate Her\".[590] Mother Jones titled its profile of her \"Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary\".[591] Following Clinton's \"choked up moment\" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[592][593] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events, \"brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades\u00a0... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics\".[593] Once she became secretary of state, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[352][594] Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[595] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[596] During 2016 she acknowledged that: \"I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed.\"[597] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

She served as First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, as a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and as the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to Donald Trump.\nRaised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992.\nAs First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the Clinton health care plan\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.\nIn 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York. She was re-elected in 2006. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was damaged in the September 11 attacks.[3] In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries.\nClinton was U.S. secretary of state in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya. She was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Her use of a private e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the e-mail controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election. Upon leaving her Cabinet position after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.\nClinton made a second presidential run in 2016. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College despite winning a plurality of the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups.\nHillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois.[4][5] She was raised in a United Methodist family who first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[6] Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent,[7] and managed a small but successful textile business, which he had founded.[8] Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[7][9][10] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[11]\nAs a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge.[12] She participated in swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[12] She has often told the story[13][14][15] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[16] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council and school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[4][17] She was elected class vice president for her junior year but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\".[18] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then-new Maine South High School. There she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted \"most likely to succeed.\" She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class.[19]\nRodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career.[10] Her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[20] She was raised in a politically conservative household,[10] and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon,[21] and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[22]\nRodham's early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[23]\nIn 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[24][25] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[26][27] As the leader of this \"Rockefeller Republican\"-oriented group,[28] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[29] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[26] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as \"a mind conservative and a heart liberal\".[30] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[31][32]\nBy her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[33] In early 1968 she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association, a position she held until early 1969.[31][34] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[33] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[31][35] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female president of the United States.[31]\nTo help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the \"Wellesley in Washington\" summer program.[33] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[33] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's \"veiled\" racist messages, and she left the Republican Party for good.[33]\nRodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[36] (Years later, while she was the first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[36])\nIn 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[37] with departmental honors in political science.[36] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of the commencement speaker, Senator Edward Brooke.[34][38] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[31][39][40] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[41][42] because of the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[38] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[43] She was asked to speak at the 50th anniversary convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington, D.C., the next year.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).[45]\nRodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital,[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey. Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]\nIn the spring of 1971, she began dating fellow law student Bill Clinton. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans and moved to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[37] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation, but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]\nRodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, \"Children Under the Law\", was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that \"child citizens\" were \"powerless individuals\"[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence on a case-by-case basis, except when there is evidence otherwise.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]\nDuring her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for it.[67] The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]\nBy then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.[68] Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, \"I chose to follow my heart instead of my head\".[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]\nAt the university, Rodham taught classes in criminal law. She was considered a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] Rodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] As a court-appointed lawyer, Rodham was required to act as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl; after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed, Rodham used an effective defense and counseled her client to plead guilty to a lesser charge. She has called the trial a \"terrible case\".[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married; she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost, and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else.[78]\nIn 1974, Bill Clinton lost an Arkansas congressional race, facing incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt.[79] Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she agreed to marry him.[80] The wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[81] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] Her motivation was threefold. She wanted to keep the couple's professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, \"it showed that I was still me\".[83] The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional.[84]\nIn 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[85][86] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[79] In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[87] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while working pro bono in child advocacy;[88] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[89]\nRodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles \"Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect\" in 1977[90] and \"Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective\" in 1979.[91] The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, \"Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.\"[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as \"one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades\".[92] Conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[93] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[94]\nIn 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[46][96] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[97] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation.[98] She held that position from 1978 until the end of 1981.[99] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to hold the job.[100] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90\u00a0million to $300\u00a0million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[88]\nFollowing her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979\u201381, 1983\u201392). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[101] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.[102]\nIn 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm.[103] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[104] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[105] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[106] At this time, the couple began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[105] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.\nOn February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[107]\nTwo years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to his job as governor of Arkansas after he won the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \"Hillary Clinton\", or sometimes \"Mrs. Bill Clinton\", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[108] During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.[114][115] In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[101][114] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][114] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[116] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[117][118]\nClinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was the first lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours[119] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[120] The firm considered her a \"rainmaker\" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[120] Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[121]\nFrom 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[122] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[123] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[124] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America\u2014in 1988 and in 1991.[125] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running. Private polls were unfavorable, however, and in the end he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[126]\nClinton was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund[4][127] and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988\u201392)[128] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985\u201392),[129] Wal-Mart Stores (1986\u201392)[130] and Lafarge (1990\u201392).[131] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[120][132] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[132] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[130][132][133] According to Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump.[134][135]\nClinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[136] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \"causing pain in my marriage\".[137] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[138] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song \"Stand by Your Man\".[d] Later in the campaign, she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers. In retrospect she admitted they were ill-considered. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \"get two for the price of one\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[144] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[93] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[145]\nWhen Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[146] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][147] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration. Her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[148] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[149][150]\nSome critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors, and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.[151] Bill Clinton's campaign promise of \"two for the price of one\" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as \"co-presidents\" or sometimes use the Arkansas label \"Billary\".[101][152][153] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into \"imaginary discussions\" with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[157][158] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's \"politics of meaning\" to overcome what she saw as America's \"sleeping sickness of the soul\"; that would lead to a willingness \"to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium\".[159][160]\nIn January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[161] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[162][163] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as \"Hillarycare\" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress.[164] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[164]\nFailing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[165] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors. The first lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50 percent range during her first year, fell to 44\u00a0percent in April 1994 and 35\u00a0percent by September 1994.[166]\nRepublicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[167] They saw a net gain of 54 seats in the House election and eight in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[168] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.[169] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use \"Hillarycare\" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[170]\nAlong with senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. This federal bill gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage. She conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[171] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[172] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. She worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]\nEnactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency. When the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare, however, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[173][174] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[173] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[173][174] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called \"sad and painful\".[174]\nTogether with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60]\nIn 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as the first lady.[60][175] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[175]\nAs First Lady of the United States, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences. These included one on Child Care (1997),[176] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[177] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[178] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000),[179] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[180]\nClinton traveled to 79\u00a0countries during this time,[181] breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon.[182] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[183] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department, without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[184] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited, and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[185] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[186]\nIn a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself. She declared, \"it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights\".[187] Delegates from over 180\u00a0countries heard her say: \"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all.\"[188] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[181][188] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.[189] During the late 1990s, she was one of the most prominent international figures to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[190][191] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[192] It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[193]\nClinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.\nThe Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from its publication in a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[194] and throughout her time as the first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[195] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed, and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators her husband had appointed.[194] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[196] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[197][198] After a two-year search, the records were found in the first lady's White House book room and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[198] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[198] Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.[199] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first spouse of a U.S. president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[197] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[200]\nScrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an action that became known as \"Travelgate\", began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[201] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo led to the investigation being focused on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[202][203] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made \"factually false\" statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[204]\nIn March 1994, newspaper reports revealed that Clinton had earned spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978\u201379.[205] The press made allegations that Clinton had engaged in a conflict of interest and disguised a bribery. Several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[206]\nAn outgrowth of the \"Travelgate\" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called \"Filegate\".[207] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[208] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[207]\nIn early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property. During the last year of Bill Clinton's time in office, those gifts were shipped to the Clintons' private residence.[209][210]\nIn 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book,[211] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies.[212][213]\nThe book spent 18\u00a0weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.[214] By 2000, it had sold 450,000\u00a0copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback.[215]\nClinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording.[216] She was the first president's wife to win a Grammy Award.[217]\nIn 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[218] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\".[219][220] She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.[222] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage. Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage.[223] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[224]\nPublic reaction varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[225] In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70\u00a0percent, the highest they had ever been.[225] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to \"a love that has persisted for decades\" and add: \"No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.\"[226]\nIssues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills. In 2014, Hillary would say she and Bill had left the White House \"not only dead broke, but in debt\". The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who give paid speeches after leaving office. The couple would also have the ability to secure loans from banks.[227]\nOther books published by Clinton when she was the first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat.[228]\nShe was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites.[229] This included the flag that inspired \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She also published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled \"Talking It Over\" from 1995 to 2000.[230][231] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[4]\nShe was head of the White House Millennium Council[232] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[233] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned by museums.[234]\nIn the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe,[235] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[236] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[237] These included changing of the Treaty Room and a presidential study to have a 19th-century look.[236] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[237] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]\nWhen New York's long-serving U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[238] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[239] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[240] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani\u2014the mayor of New York City\u2014as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public. Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.[241]\nBill de Blasio was Clinton's campaign manager. She began her drive to the U.S. Senate by visiting all 62 counties in the state, in a \"listening tour\" of small-group settings.[242] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000\u00a0jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[243]\nThe contest drew national attention. During a September debate, Lazio blundered when he seemed to invade Clinton's personal space by trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[244] Their campaigns, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90\u00a0million.[245] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55\u00a0percent of the vote to Lazio's 43\u00a0percent.[244] She was sworn in as U.S. senator on January 3, 2001.[246]\nPublisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8\u00a0million in December 2000 for her autobiography, released in 2003, as Living History.[247]\nUpon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[248] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[157][249] She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001\u201302),[250] Committee on Armed Services (2003\u201309),[251] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001\u201309), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001\u201309)[250] and Special Committee on Aging.[252]\nShe was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[253] (2001\u201309).[254]\nFollowing the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21\u00a0billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment.[255] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[256] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties.[257] In March 2006 she voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 that had gained large majority support.[258]\nClinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[259] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[260]\nAfter the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[261] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000\u00a0soldiers to ease the strain.[262] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay \"until the job is done\" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis \"an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves\".[263] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[264] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[265][266] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[266] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying she \"got it wrong\" and the vote in support had been a \"mistake\".[267])\nClinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[268] Simon &amp; Schuster released Living History:[247] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[269] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[270] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[271] Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[272]\nClinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as chief justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[273][274]\nIn 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[275] Along with senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[268][276]\nLooking to establish a \"progressive infrastructure\" to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff John Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[277] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[278]\nIn November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term. She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[279] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[280] Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former Mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67\u00a0percent of the vote to Spencer's 31\u00a0percent,[281] carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties.[282] Her campaign spent $36\u00a0million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[283] In the following months, she transferred $10\u00a0million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[284]\nClinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful).[h] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[286] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80\u201314 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[287] She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, \"I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.\"[288]\nIn March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[289] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[290]\nAs the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700\u00a0billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74\u201325.[291]\nIn 2007, Clinton and Virginia senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[292]\nClinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. president since at least early 2003.[293] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \"I'm in and I'm in to win.\"[294] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president.\nWhen Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50\u00a0million.[295] They had earned over $100\u00a0million since 2000\u2014most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities.[296]\nThroughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[260] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[260] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[297]\nAt the end of October, Clinton fared poorly in her debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[298][299] Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton's message of experience.[300]\nIn the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January\u00a03 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards.[301] Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary.[302] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, narrowly defeating Obama.[303] It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.[304] Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.[305]\nThe nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[306] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[i] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[307] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[306][308] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[308] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February\u00a05 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign, and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president \"needs to stop\".[309] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[310]\nOn Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[311] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[312] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[313]\nThe Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[300][314] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff, and she made several top-level personnel changes.[314][315] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[313][314] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[314] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[316] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare.[300][313] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[317][318] Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[319]\nFollowing the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[320] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[321] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640\u00a0pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763;[322] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395,[323] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[322] Clinton and Obama each received over 17\u00a0million votes during the nomination process[j] with both breaking the previous record.[324] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[304] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[325] Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13\u00a0million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[326]\nIn mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration.[327] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position.[328][329] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state.[330][331] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\".[331] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.[332]\nThe appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[333] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the committee voted 16\u20131 to approve Clinton.[334] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65\u00a0percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[335] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94\u20132.[336] Clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state, resigning from the Senate later that day.[337] She became the first former first lady to be a member of the United States Cabinet.[338]\nClinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: \"We have a lot of damage to repair.\"[339] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department, and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[340] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[341] The first such review was issued in late 2010. It called for the U.S. leading through \"civilian power\" as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises.[342] It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world.[188] A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[328]\nIn a 2009 internal debate regarding the War in Afghanistan, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal \"Afghanistan surge\", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal. She prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[266][343]\nIn March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a \"reset button\" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[344][345] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office.[344] Relations would worsen considerably, however, following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012.[346] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish\u2013Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[347][348] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[186][k] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[328][350][351]\nClinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[352][353] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[354] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[328] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[353] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[355][356] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[328]\nIn a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[357] Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it. The speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[358]\nIn July 2010, she visited South Korea, where she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the Caracol Industrial Park would have a key tenant.[359] This was part of the \"build back better\" program initiated by her husband, named UN Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 after a tropical storm season caused $1 billion in damages to the island.[360] In January 2011, Clinton traveled to Haiti in order to help pave the way for the election of Michel Martelly.[361]\nThe 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration.[362] Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was \"stable\", to a stance that there needed to be an \"orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government\", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[363][364] Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[362] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[365]\nAs the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power This was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[365][366][367] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. The State Department's legal advisor argued the same point when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[368] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called \"convening power\" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[366] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state.[369] The wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[370][371][372]\nDuring April 2011, internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[373][374] Following the completion of the mission on May\u00a02 resulting in bin Laden's death, Clinton played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[375] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000\u201320,000 U.S. troops there. (All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed.)[266][376]\nIn a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that, \"Gay rights are human rights\", and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[377] The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955. She met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[378][379] She also said the 21st century would be \"America's Pacific century\",[380] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's \"pivot to Asia\".[381]\nDuring the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform. As government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, they called for him to resign from the presidency.[382] The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria.[383] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels. The proposal was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict, fearing that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[378][384]\nIn December 2012, Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.[385] Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[385][386] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication, and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.[386][387][l]\nThroughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values. In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[366][392] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[393] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[266][354][376] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[394]\nClinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-\u00e0-vis their governments.[366]\nAnd in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[188] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the \"Hillary Doctrine\", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state, and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[352][395] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[396]\nClinton visited 112\u00a0countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[397][m] (Time magazine wrote that \"Clinton's endurance is legendary\".)[366] The first secretary of state to visit countries like Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[400] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[367] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor.[386] Her last day as secretary of state was February 1, 2013.[401] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had accomplished,[355][356] and highlighted her focus on goals she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[402] She has also been criticized for accepting millions in dollars in donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State.[403]\nOn September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[404] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[404][405]\nOn December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[406] It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[407] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[406]\nClinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident, and while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[408] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate \"talking points\" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\"[408][409]\nIn November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's response to the attack.[410]\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[411] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[411][412] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation.[411][413] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[414][415] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[414] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[416] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines.[411] The Republican report offered some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[412]\nA controversy arose in March 2015, when the State Department's inspector general revealed that Clinton had used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server exclusively\u2014instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers\u2014when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements.[417] The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[418][419]\nIn a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and \"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system\". They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[420] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[421] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called \"born classified\" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[422] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[423] Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails \"contained classified State Department information when originated\".[424] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[425]\nClinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, \"I never sent or received any classified material\u2014they are retroactively classifying it.\" On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: \"Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\"[426][427]\nOn July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:\n110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were \"up-classified\" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[423][428]Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small \"c\" in parentheses, described as \"portion markings\" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not \"technically sophisticated\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[428] The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Comey acknowledged that it was \"possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account\". He added that \"[although] we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\". Nevertheless, Comey asserted that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of \"potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information\". The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute.[423] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2014who had met privately with Bill Clinton on June 27[429][430]\u2014confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges.[431]\nOn October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails. Law enforcement officials said that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed the conclusion it had reached in July.[432] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[433] The emails controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election.[434][435][436]\nIn September 2019, the State Department finished its internal review into 33,000 emails that Clinton had turned over. The investigation that began in 2016 found 588 violations of security procedures and found that Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information. In 91 cases, the culpability of sending classified information could be attributed to 38 people, but the review concluded there was \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\".[437][438]\nWhen Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years.[439] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[440] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600\u00a0million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[440][441]\nIn 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as secretary of state. As of July\u00a02015[update], the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[442]\nClinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[443] its March 2015 report said that while \"There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman\u00a0... this data shows just how far we still have to go.\"[444] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state.[n] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[447]\nShe began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[448] There she received $200,000\u2013225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[448][449] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[448] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11\u00a0million from her speeches.[450] For the overall period 2007\u201314, the Clintons earned almost $141\u00a0million, paid some $56\u00a0million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15\u00a0million to charity.[451] As of 2015[update], she was estimated to be worth over $30\u00a0million on her own, or $45\u201353\u00a0million with her husband.[452]\nClinton resigned from the board of the foundation in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign. The foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[n]\nOn April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[453] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[454] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[455] Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[456][457] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[453] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.[449][457]\nIn the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders\u2014[458][459] the first woman to win them.[458] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[460] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[461] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[462] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[461] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[461]\nOn March 1 Super Tuesday, Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters. She opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[463] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout. Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents. Clinton did better among older, black and Hispanic voter populations, and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[464][465][466]\nBy June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[467] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn becoming the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[468] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47.[469] She received almost 17\u00a0million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13\u00a0million.[470]\nClinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[471] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[472] Her opponents in the general election included Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Around the time of the convention, WikiLeaks released emails that suggested the DNC and the Clinton campaign tilted the primary in Clinton's favor.\nClinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton were tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[473][474] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified government material.[475] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a three to four percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention. This was in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the low side by historical standards.[476][477][478] Following Clinton's seven percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[479][480] In fall 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States.[481]\nClinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016, presidential election.[482] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win; media sources proclaimed him the winner.[483] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave his victory speech.[484] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying: \"We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.\"[485] Though Clinton lost the election by capturing only 232 electoral votes to Trump's 306, she won the popular vote by more than 2.8\u00a0million votes, or 2.1% of the voter base.[486][487] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[o][488][489] She won the most votes of any candidate who did not take office and the third-most votes of any candidate in history,[490][491] though she did not have the greatest percentage win of a losing candidate. (Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by 10.4% but lost to John Quincy Adams).[492]\nOn December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes being cast instead for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle, and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[493]\nIn their respective capacities as a former president and a former first lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the inauguration of Donald Trump with their daughter, Chelsea. The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, \"I'm here today to honor our democracy &amp; its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country &amp; its future.\"[494]\nClinton delivered a St. Patrick's Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 2017, referring to reports of her being seen taking walks in the woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election.[495][496] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from \"the woods\" and become politically active again.[495]\nOn March 24, 2017, after the postponement of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day \"a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance\" and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[497] She went on to call the American Health Care Act \"a disastrous bill\" during a San Francisco speech four days later.[498] After the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act on May 4, Clinton dubbed it a \"shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP\".[499] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, \"This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.\"[500]\nClinton commented that she would not seek public office again in April.[501] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the U.S. should take out Bashar al-Assad's airfields and thereby \"prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them\".[502]\nIn May 2017 Clinton announced the formation of Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote is \"dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election\".[503] In a June 2017 appearance at a Baltimore fundraiser for the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel (ECYP), Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: \"When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program's mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.\"[504] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, \"2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we're all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff &amp; heroic police.\"[505]\nClinton's third memoir, What Happened, an account of her devastating loss in the 2016 election, was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and as an audiobook read by the author.[506] A book tour and a series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[507] What Happened sold 300,000 copies in its first week,[508][509] less than her 2003 memoir, Living History, but triple the first-week sales of her previous memoir, 2014's Hard Choices.[508][510] Simon &amp; Schuster announced that What Happened had sold more e-books in its first-week than any nonfiction e-book since 2010.[508] As of December 10, 2017, the book had sold 448,947 hardcover copies.[511]\nAn announcement was made in February 2017 that efforts were under way to render her 1996 book It Takes a Village as a picture book.[512] Marla Frazee, a two-time winner of the Caldecott Medal, was announced as the illustrator.[512] Clinton had worked on it with Frazee during her 2016 presidential election campaign.[513] The result was published on the same day of publication as What Happened.[514][513] The book is aimed at preschool-aged children, although a few messages are more likely better understood by adults.[513]\nIn October 2018, Hillary and Bill Clinton announced plans for a 13-city speaking tour in various cities in the United States and Canada between November 2018 and May 2019.[515] Hillary was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in law (LLD) at Queen's University Belfast on October 10, 2018, after giving a speech on Northern Ireland and the impacts of Brexit at Whitla Hall, Belfast.[516] In June 2018, Trinity College Dublin awarded her with an honorary doctorate (LLD).[517]\nA package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Clinton's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. It was intercepted by the Secret Service. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders and to CNN.[518][519]\nOn March 4, 2019, Clinton announced that she would not run for president in 2020.[520] In October 2019, Trump tweeted that Clinton should run for a third time, prompting her response of \"don't tempt me\".[521]\nOn February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indian men by Adam Purinton.[522] On May 2, Clinton said Trump's use of Twitter \"doesn't work\" when pursuing important negotiations. \"Kim Jong Un\u00a0... [is] always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position\". Negotiations with North Korea should not take place without \"a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.\"[523] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump's 2018 budget proposal was \"a con\" for underfunding domestic programs.[524] On June 1, when President Trump announced withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a \"historic mistake\".[525]\nOn September 29, 2019, in an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Clinton described Trump as a \"threat\" to the country's standing in the world, an \"illegitimate president\", despite having won the election, and a \"corrupt human tornado\".[526]\nOn January 2, 2020, it was announced that Hillary Clinton would take up the position of Chancellor at Queen's University Belfast after her husband had previously played a role in the Northern Ireland peace process and the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Clinton became the 11th and first female chancellor of the university, filling the position that had been vacant since 2018 after the death of her predecessor, Thomas J. Moran. Commenting on taking up the position, she said that \u201cthe university is making waves internationally for its research and impact and I am proud to be an ambassador and help grow its reputation for excellence\". Queen's Pro-Chancellor Stephen Prenter said that Clinton on her appointment \"will be an incredible advocate for Queen's\" who can act as an \"inspirational role model\".[527][528]\nUsing her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically. National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of\u00a01 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[529] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[530]\nA 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[531]\nThe Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75\u00a0liberal, 23\u00a0conservative; Social = 83\u00a0liberal, 6\u00a0conservative; Foreign = 66\u00a0liberal, 30\u00a0conservative. Total average = 75\u00a0liberal, 20\u00a0conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, \"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.\"[532]\nOrganizations have also attempted to provide more recent assessments of Clinton after she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in the \"Left Liberal\" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances, with an economic score of ten on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[533] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[534] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90\u00a0percent \"Liberal Quotient\" from Americans for Democratic Action,[535] and a lifetime eight\u00a0percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[536]\nIn March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \"optimistic\" and \"wide-ranging\". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \"clawback\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[537] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as \"the gold standard\"[538] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that \"any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\".[539][540] As senator (2001\u20132009), her record on trade was mixed; she voted in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[539]\nGiven the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit \"unaccountable money\" in politics.[541] In July 2016, she \"committed\" to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[542][543] On December 7, 2015, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities in the New York Times.[544]\nAccepting the scientific consensus on climate change, Clinton supports cap-and-trade,[545] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[546]\nShe supported \"equal pay for equal work\", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[547] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[541] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a \"fair share surcharge\".[548]\nClinton supported the Affordable Care Act[549] and would have added a \"public option\" that competed with private insurers and enabled people \"50 or 55 and up\" to buy into Medicare.[550][551]\nOn LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage.[541] In 2013, Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage; in 2000, she was against such marriages altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages.[552] In 2000, she was the first spouse of a US president to march in an LGBT pride parade.[553] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[554]\nClinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship \"[i]s at its heart a family issue\",[555] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[556][557] However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border \"should be sent back.\"[558] She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[559]\nExpressing support for Common Core[560] she said, \"The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized\u00a0... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.\"[561]\nOn foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002,[562] a vote she later \"regretted\".[563] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[564] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[565][566] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[559] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \"America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.\"[567] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[568][569] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[570]\nIn 2000, Clinton advocated for the elimination of the electoral college.[571] She promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it, resulting in the direct election of the president.[572][573]\nClinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:\nClinton discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[574] However, she has seldom discussed her faith while campaigning.[575][576] She has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and \"creating opportunities for others to be lifted up\".[576] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that \"Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.\"[576]\nProfessor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.\"[575] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy \"made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith\".[577]\nOver a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found \"a virtual cottage industry\" of \"anti-Clinton literature\" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints. Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless\u00a0... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[578] (other than her memoirs and those of her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[579] Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \"bogeyman\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[580]\nClinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture in a wide spectrum of perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[581] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, \"Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.\"[582] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as the first lady. She has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelg\u00e4ngers.[583][584] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her including \"The Hillary Shimmy Song\", which went viral.[585][586][587][588]\nShe has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, though some argue otherwise.[589] In the early stages of her 2008 presidential campaign, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her with two checkboxes labeled \"Love Her\", \"Hate Her\".[590] Mother Jones titled its profile of her \"Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary\".[591] Following Clinton's \"choked up moment\" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[592][593] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events, \"brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades\u00a0... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics\".[593]\nOnce she became secretary of state, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[352][594] Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[595] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[596] During 2016 she acknowledged that: \"I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed.\"[597]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"
